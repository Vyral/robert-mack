        "content": "Gain a competitive edge in the low-inventory real estate market.Today, Iâm here to address all of the buyers who are navigating this challenging market with low inventory. If youâre an agent feeling frustrated with the slim pickings, this message is for you too. Waiting for properties to be listed on the MLS isnât enough. Itâs time to take proactive steps to create inventory for yourself or your clients. Here are three effective strategies:1. Engage with the community. Door-knock, mail, or call neighborhoods where you and your clients are interested in buying. Just because a property isnât listed doesnât mean someone in that community isnât considering selling. Stir the pot by reaching out and uncovering potential sellers who may not have listed their homes yet.âWaiting for properties to be listed on the MLS isnât enough.â2. Connect with local experts. Identify the top-producing real estate agents who dominate the area youâre focusing on. Whether itâs a specific pocket in Newport Beach or any other location, reach out to these agents. They may have pocket listings or upcoming properties that havenât hit the market yet. Building relationships can give you a sneak peek and an advantage.3. Expired, canceled, and withdrawn listings. Explore properties that were previously listed but didnât sell. Sometimes sellers withdraw their listings without relisting them, yet their motivation to sell may still be intact. As an agent, reach out to these sellers and inquire about their continued interest in selling. This presents an opportunity to put together off-market deals.If youâre seeking more inventory, itâs time to shift your mindset from complaining to proactive searching. By implementing these three strategies, you can create opportunities and find properties that others might miss. Take action, think outside the box, and make the most of this challenging market. Together, we can navigate the low inventory landscape and find your dream home. Remember, if you have any questions about this topic or real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to help you out.",

        "content": "Learn about the impact of commission on your bottom line.Today, Iâm here to address all the sellers out there, particularly those who are seeking a good deal. My question to you is: How confident are you that paying less commission will result in more money in your pocket?The topic of commissions is quite common in the real estate world these days, isnât it? Many people believe that real estate agents are overpaid. If you were to ask a real estate agent about the effort and work involved in earning their commission, they would tell you that itâs a substantial amount. However, agents are often treated as commodities.Why is that? Itâs because many agents are willing to offer discounts and be seen as commodities. However, does paying an agent less guarantee that you will ultimately net more money? Thatâs the crux of the conversation. Many sellers express their desire to maximize their profits from the sale in order to have a substantial down payment for their next home or investment property.However, does paying a lower commission truly translate to an improved bottom line? What Iâve observed is that sometimes a lower commission means a lower level of service, and a lower level of service can lead to mistakes in marketing, home preparation, pricing strategies, or negotiations, which can ultimately result in a home selling for less.âHow confident are you that paying less commission will result in more money in your pocket?âOftentimes, a seller says that their home will sell itself, given the high demand and low inventory in the current market. I donât doubt that the home will sell, but what sets apart a home selling for its market price from one that sells for 2% to 10% more? Itâs the difference in strategiesâa unique approach to home preparation, pricing, marketing, and negotiation.How certain are you, as a seller, that my team and I canât sell your home for 3% more than what another agent, charging you 2% less, can achieve? These are the questions I urge you to consider. If youâre contemplating selling your home, does a lower commission always equate to more money in your pocket?My answer leans toward âmaybe not.â Remember, if you have any questions about this topic or real estate in general, please feel free to reach out to me by phone or email. I would be happy to help you out.",

        "content": "Three important things sellers need to know before listing their homes.Are you thinking about listing your home in todayâs crazy market? If so, there are three things you need to know:Â 1. Many sellers are staying put, so youâll have less competition. Many sellers want to keep their low interest rates and monthly payments, and theyâre worried about the lack of inventory when they turn around and buy. Therefore, if you need to sell today, youâll face almost no competition.Â 2. Demand is very high. Less competition is driving up demand, so know that a lot of people want to buy your home. A great property at a great price almost always gets multiple offers in this current climate, and multiple offers mean record sales prices.Â 3. Your strategy matters. Too many sellers think that because the market is hot, they can just list their house as-is and see what they get. However, thatâs the worst way to sell a home. You need the right agent to help you form the right strategy. Then you can get at least 10% more for your sales price.Â These tips will help when you list your home. If you have any questions or want our help selling, please donât hesitate to reach out! You can call or email us anytime, and we would be happy to help you get the most for your home.",

Rates might fall, but donât wait. Rates are around 6.5%, but experts predict they will fall to the 5% range soon. However, if this is making you want to wait, I would encourage you to reconsider. This is because most other buyers will be doing the same thing. Therefore, if you wait until rates go down, competition will be fierce.Â 2. Home prices are still rising. This is another reason why you shouldnât wait to buy because then homes will just be more expensive. Plus, when buyers flock to the market, multiple offers will also drive up prices. If you buy now, you can get a lower price.Â 3. Your strategy matters. A lot of buyers are moving slowly, waiting until they find the right home to talk to a lender and get preapproved. However, that doesnât work. Homes are selling quickly, so only the most motivated and prepared buyers are winning. Therefore, start talking to a lender and attack the market like a professional.Â These tips will help you as you go to buy a home. If you have any questions or want our help buying, please donât hesitate to reach out! You can call or email us anytime, and we would be happy to help you buy your dream home.",

Still, if youâre determined to purchase a home, here are three reasons why you should act sooner rather than later:Â 1. Less competition. There is a high demand for housing, coupled with a low inventory, creating competition among buyers. If interest rates decrease by 1% in the next three to 12 months, demand will likely increase even further. Purchasing now means less competition.2. Lower prices. As competition grows and interest rates decrease, prices will likely increase. Buying now may result in a better price on your desired home.Â 3. Peace of mind.

        "content": "Five factors to consider when determining how much your home is worth.Home sellers often ask us for comps to gauge their propertyâs value, but determining your propertyâs worth goes beyond just comparing similar properties. Today, weâll share the factors that contribute to determining your homeâs value:1. Comps: Recent sales in the area provide a solid starting point, as they reflect what buyers have previously been willing to pay for homes in the neighborhood.2. Showability: What does your home look like when somebody walks in? Is it cluttered? Is it move-in ready? Does it look like a model home? The bottom line is that buyers buy homes based on emotion. The higher the emotional connection, the higher the offer will be. The lower the emotional connection, the lower the offer will be, or worse, no offer at all.âDetermining your propertyâs worth goes beyond just comparing similar properties.â3. Pricing: You can price your home high, at market value, or even aggressively to get multiple offers and create a bidding frenzy. How you price your home determines the exposure your home gets, how many eyeballs are on your home, and how many buyers walk in.Â 4. Competition: Demand matters when it comes to sales. If your home is in a neighborhood with 10 active homes available for sale, demand is going to be lower compared to an area that has maybe zero to three homes available for sale. So when weâre looking at determining value, weâre also looking at what our competition looks like.5. Market trends: Sometimes, the market is very dynamic. Three months ago might be a very different market than the one weâre dealing with today. So when weâre talking to a homeowner, and theyâre wondering what the value of their home is, we need to understand when they want to put their home on the market.If you have any questions about determining the value of your home, call or email us.

Despite interest rates being much higher than they were in 2021, we continue to see many homes get multiple offers. While affordability has decreased, there are a few factors that contribute to this trend.Â Firstly, inventory levels remain significantly low, with just over 2,000 homes available for sale in Orange County. In comparison, 2019 was a low inventory year, but there were 6,500 homes available at that time. Currently, inventory is about 70% lower than in 2019.Secondly, demand remains high. About 1,600 homes were sold in the previous month, resulting in an absorption rate of 1.3 months. This means that, without new listings, all available homes would be sold in 1.3 months. For context, in 2019, there were 7,000 homes available for sale and 3,000 sold monthly, yielding an absorption rate of 2.5 months.The ongoing multiple offers can be attributed to high demand and low supply.

Youâre not alone. Uncertainty can lead to doubt, which can then lead to fear and paralysis. But, there are ways to eliminate uncertainty and create more certainty, which can lead to taking action. Here are three things to focus on if youâre considering buying a home:1. Job security.Â Do you have a stable job with good income? If you do, and you can afford to buy a home, thatâs a good sign. A stable job will help ensure that you can continue to make mortgage payments and maintain your home over the long term.âDonât let uncertainty hold you back from taking action.â2. Loan options.Â Have you spoken to a lender? It always comes down to math. Forget about whatâs going on in the marketplace. Forget about where interest rates are or whether prices are going up or down. If youâre motivated enough to buy and plan on living in the property long term, just get preapproved and figure out what your total monthly payment will be. Then, determine if that payment falls within your budget.3. Motivation.Â If you have a high motivation to buy and you can afford it, and your job is stable, then now may be the best time. Donât let uncertainty hold you back from making a decision that could improve your life in the long term.By focusing on these three factors, you can eliminate uncertainty and move forward with confidence in your decision to buy a home.

        "content": "Five tips to help sellers sell their homes quickly and for more money.Selling your home can be a daunting task, but it can also be a rewarding one. Before you list your property, there are a few things you must know. TodayÂ  we will discuss five ways to maximize the emotional connection between your home and potential buyers, ultimately leading to a better selling price.1. Repairs.Â Buyers want to see a property that is well-maintained and move-in ready. Even minor defects or eyesores can turn off potential buyers. Therefore, itâs essential to make any necessary repairs before you list your property. Not only will this improve the overall appearance of your home, but it will also show buyers that you have taken care of the property.2. Paint. One of the easiest and most affordable ways to update your homeâs look is to give it a fresh coat of paint. If your home looks dark or outdated, consider brightening it up with some fresh white paint. Not only will it make your home feel more inviting, but it will also give buyers a blank slate to imagine themselves in the space.âCreate an emotional connection between your home and the buyers.â3. Carpet. If your home has carpet, take a critical look at it. Does it look good or is it old and ratty? If itâs the latter, consider cleaning it or replacing it altogether. Buyers want to see a property that is move-in ready, and old carpet can be a turn-off.4. Design. A cluttered home can turn off potential buyers, so itâs important to declutter before listing your property. Better yet, hire a stager or designer to help you design the entire space. They can help create a cohesive look that will appeal to a broader range of buyers, ultimately increasing your chances of selling your home quickly.5. Price. One of the most critical factors in selling your home is pricing it correctly. Pricing your property too high can lead to it sitting on the market for months, ultimately resulting in a lower selling price. Therefore, itâs essential to price your home at or slightly below market value for the best results.By following these five tips, you can maximize the emotional connection between your home and potential buyers, ultimately leading to a better sales price.

So if homes are selling every single day and the narrative is that itâs not a great time to buy, who is buying these homes?I did a review of all the clients weâve been serving, and there are three primary types of buyers weâve been working with within this market. I want to share that with you so that you can learn a little bit more about who is transacting right now, even though rates might be higher and affordability might be lower.1. Homeowners that need more space. There are families weâre working with right now that are bursting at the seams in their current homes. So whether rates are in the fours or the sevens, they are desperately looking for ways to upgrade. In the past, Iâve talked about it: math plus motivation. The motivation is very high, so theyâre looking for ways to make the math work, and creative lenders are finding a way.âThe narrative is that itâs not a great time to buy, so who is buying these homes?â2. Buyers that are looking for cash flow or passive income. Right now, the economy is very volatile. Youâre seeing news about banks closing right now. The savvy buyers want to be able to park their money into a hard asset, something like real estate, something thatâs not going to go anywhere. So if they can put enough money down or buy this property in cash, they can create a safe haven for their money, create tax benefits over time, and create passive income.3. The relocation buyer. People are relocating from all over the world to California, especially Southern California, and they want to buy. Many people are moving from different parts of the country or the world, saying, âIâve owned my home for the last 20 years; Iâm not going to rent. I want to buy. The rates may not be perfect, but I want to buy. So whatâs the strategy?âHopefully, you found that interesting and enlightening.

As the spring season approaches, the real estate market usually sees a surge in home listings, making it the most active time of the year. However, this yearâs inventory is surprisingly low, leaving many wondering why. Here are three major factors that may have contributed to the low supply:1. Homeowners donât want to lose their current rate. Many homeowners who were considering upgrading or downsizing have recently refinanced their homes at lower interest rates in the 2% or 3% range. With the cost of larger homes on the rise, and rates now higher, homeowners are hesitant to give up their current low rates. They find it more financially sensible to stay put, which has contributed to the low inventory levels.âMany individuals remain concerned about a looming recession and a possible bubble burst.â2. There are no other options.Â Most homeowners who are considering listing are hesitant because there is nothing for them to move into. Therefore, some decide not to list their homes at all.3. The looming financial fear. Despite data suggesting that the real estate market may not experience a crash, many individuals remain concerned about a looming recession and a possible bubble burst.

On the flip side, if the market becomes more affordable, all the other buyers waiting on the sidelines like you, will jump into the market, and demand will skyrocket.

There are a lot of moving parts in our housing market, so today Iâll break everything down and explain what it means for buyers and sellers.Â First, letâs talk about interest rates. They have been a hot topic lately, and are hovering right around the low 6% range, which is great news. We are experiencing the lowest interest rates that weâve seen since last September, and mortgage applications are up 28% since last month. Buyers are finding relief in their affordability, and sellers have more demand.Â Next, letâs talk about inventory. At the beginning of 2022, we had about 1,000 homes available for sale. Now, we have about 2,500. To put this into perspective, before the pandemic, we had about 6,000 homes available for sale, so weâre still dealing with low inventory.âSellers are willing to help buyers buy down their interest rate.âAs far as housing prices go, every area and house is different. Some people think houses will appreciate like normal, while others think our market might even out. Either way, homes are still selling for great prices if their sellers do the right things. The bottom line is weâre not seeing prices soaring and shooting up like they did last year.Â One of the best things about our current market is that buyers can negotiate again. Before, you just had to put in your best offer and cross your fingers. Now, you can have a conversation with your seller, and in many cases, theyâre willing to help you buy down your interest rate to make their price more affordable.

        "content": "This market may be scary, but these five truths will prepare you to succeed.Today Iâm here to talk to you guys about five truths you need to know before you get ready to list your home:1. Home preparation is key. This is one of the most important things to consider when you go to list your property. Buyers buy based on emotion. If youâre selling a home thatâs empty, cluttered, or disorganized, youâre not going to get top dollar. In a market where buyers are hypercritical about the product theyâre buying and looking for reasons why they shouldnât buy, your home needs to look perfect.2. Price it right. Buyers are looking to pay below market value for a home right now. Buyers were paying above market value to get a property last year, and now that the interest rates have gone up a little bit, buyersâ expectations have changed. Many sources are saying that prices may continue to decline, so buyers are expecting that. Therefore, pricing is critical.âBuyers buy based on emotion.â3. Buckle up for a bumpy ride. Selling your home is going to be a massive disruption. If your agent tells you that this is going to be smooth and easy, theyâre not being fully honest with you. There are things that we can do to make the selling process as smooth as possible, but the bottom line is that itâs going to take a lot of time and work, so mentally prepare for that.Â 4. Use the right agent. Your listing agent matters more than you may think. In the last year and a half, the process has been easy. However, that strong market created a lot of weak agents with bad habits. Now that the market has shifted, make sure to work with an agent who understands the shift and how to use it to your advantage. Todayâs market is about collecting offers, analyzing them, responding to them, negotiating aggressively, and then facilitating a close because the deal doesnât matter until the deal is closed.Â 5. Youâll make up for the loss when you buy. 65% of sellers need to be a buyer. Therefore, if you have to take a little bit of a haircut on your sale because the market has changed, know that every area is different. Youâre going to be able to make up that loss when you buy.If youâre thinking about selling, consider those five things.

        "content": "Connecting with an agent early will make your transaction much smoother.Today I want to talk to all the motivated buyers and sellers about talking to a real estate agent, even before youâre ready to actually buy or sell. You should get connected to a real estate agent sooner rather than later. Why? Having time on your side gives you the ability to strategize.I recently visited my friend, and he told me that he will buy in the next six to 12 months. The first thing I said was, âHave you connected with an agent, talked to a lender, and made a plan?â He said he hadnât because the last time he told an agent that he wanted to buy in the near future, they wouldnât leave him alone, so he just started ignoring them.âWork with your agent to come up with a plan ahead of time.âAlthough I understand that mindset of wanting to wait, the bottom line is that if you connect with an agent, you have lots of time to put a foolproof plan together so you can get exactly what you want in the amount of time you want to get it. This also means that the price and terms will be favorable because you actually had time to prepare.Â I highly recommend finding a great real estate agent that you can trust. Be honest with them, and tell them that youâre contacting them now to come up with a plan of attack and that you donât want to constantly get emails from them. Let them know what your goals are, and work with your agent to come up with a plan so you can win.If youâre in the Orange County area and want to put a plan together, my team and I would love the opportunity to earn your future business.

Many homeowners think that itâs a bad time to list, but itâs quite the opposite. Here are three reasons why it might be a great time to sell your home during the holiday season:Â 1. Less competition. The narrative says itâs not a good time to sell during the holidays, so many sellers are taking their homes off the market or waiting until the new year to put them on the market. That means less competition now and more competition in the new year if you wait.âBuyers can afford more home now than even just one month ago.â2. Motivated buyers. Only motivated buyers are looking to buy a home during the holiday season. If they werenât motivated, theyâd be spending time with friends and family, traveling, and doing holiday stuff. If theyâre looking now, there might be a need to buy before the end of the year, and your home might be the perfect fit.3. Affordability is up. Rates shot up into the mid-7% range recently. With a 3-1 buydown, you can get your rate starting as low as 3.5% with creative financing and aggressive lending guidelines. Buyers can afford more home now than even just one month ago.If youâre a seller with strong motivation, now may be a perfect time for you to sell.

The weather might be cool, but you can still find a hot deal. Here are three reasons why you can get a deal during the holidays:1. Motivated sellers. The narrative right now is that itâs not a good time to sell. Many homeowners arenât putting their homes on the market, so if someone is on the market right now, there is probably a real motivation for them to sell. As a result, you might be able to negotiate a significantly better deal.Â âIf youâre looking to buy, now might be a great time to act.â2. Less competition. Unless buyers are truly motivated, theyâre not looking during the holiday season, so thereâs less direct competition. Theyâre out traveling, spending time with friends and family, and doing holiday stuff instead.3. Affordability. Rates were very high about two to four weeks ago. Theyâve come down now to the low-6% range for a 30-year fixed. If you get a creative loan like an ARM or a 3-1 buydown, you could start your rates between 3% and 4%.

Iâd rather get rejected than always wonder if she would have said yes.â That advice has stuck with me since 1993. Thatâs the message I want to convey to all the buyers out there today.Right now, the narrative is that itâs not a good time to buy because the rates are at 7%, but that doesnât mean itâs not generally a good time to buy. If you want to do something, you should at least give it the old college try. If you want to buy, but donât think itâs the right time, connect with a lender and talk about your options. The beauty of a mortgage loan officer is that thereâs no cost or obligation to meeting with them.âItâs better to get rejected than to always wonder.âExplore your financial options, and if those show that it makes sense to buy a home in todayâs market despite rising rates, connect with a real estate agent because sellers are extremely negotiable right now.Itâs fine if the lender says, âThanks for coming in and trying, but right now, you just donât financially qualify.â Then you can rent and put a plan together to buy in the future, but wanting to do something and not trying to do it just because you donât think itâs the right time is not the right way to go.

If youâre going to analyze the state of the market, you should look at three things: inventory, interest rates, and days on market.Â Inventory has changed a lot throughout this year. In January, we had just over 1,000 homes available for sale. At the peak of this year, which was August, there were 4,000! That is a big jump. Currently, there are 3,650 homes available, so still a lot.Â In January, interest rates were between 3% and 3.25%. Today theyâre between 7% and 7.5%. This rise in interest rates has created a decrease in affordability. Also, in January, homes were selling in less than a week. Today, homes are taking two to four months to sell, depending on the price point and the strategy. Therefore, all three of those indicators show how much the market has changed with the decrease in demand and increase in supply.Â âI truly believe that both buyers and sellers can do well in this current market.âThen what should people do about that? A couple of my suggestions for buyers would be to check their motivation and look at financing options. Rates are high, but there are still a lot of pros for buyers in this market. Lenders can use creative financing, there are more homes for sale, thereâs more time to make a thoughtful decision, prices can be negotiated again, terms are more favorable, and rates can be bought down.Â For sellers to thrive in this market, you should check your motivation, hire a professional, price your home correctly, prepare your home well, keep an open mind, and use your proceeds wisely.Â I truly believe that both buyers and sellers can do well in this current market.

The reality is youâll only accept one offer, so as long as itâs a good one, it doesnât matter how many others you receive. Here are three things you can do to make sure you get the best offer possible:1. Prep your home. Show buyers that you care about your house. The more expensive your home looks, the better your final offer will be.Â 2. Price aggressively. This way, more buyers will visit your home. If you generate more competition, buyers will feel pressured to put in their best offer.3. Donât sell your home short. While you have to price aggressively, donât undersell your house. You may only receive one offer, so make sure buyers know what price you think is acceptable.Â If you have questions about this topic, please call or email me.

My wife and I are trying to buy a new home, and we feel all the emotions! Thatâs why I want to give you the best advice I can to ensure we are making the right decisions in this fluctuating market. Here are five amazing opportunities in the marketplace right now:Â 1. There are more homes on the market. I love the fact that every day, new options are opening up. This is a big change from recent months.Â 2. Homes are staying on the market longer. This gives buyers the chance to see a house more than once before putting in an offer. Having the time to be more confident in the decision is huge.âRemember to focus on the excitement rather than the doom and gloom.â3. There is less competition. Fewer competitors give you more of a chance to succeed.4. Negotiation is now possible. In recent months, this wasnât something people could even consider. Now buyers can ask for things like contingencies and price reductions.Â 5. The current interest rates are just temporary. You never know if rates will go up or down, but there are many creative financing options you can consider. Donât let rising rates stop you.Â There will always be a reason why a person shouldnât buy a home. Many buyers were waiting to buy until the inventory increased, they had more time to decide, and there was less competitionâwell now they got all that! However, interest rates are rising. The point is that thereâs always going to be something that might hold you back, but you have to reach the point where you push through, and now is a great time to do that.

        "content": "Donât let negative media scare you away from purchasing a home.Hereâs something that all potential buyers in todayâs market should understand: Itâs never the right time to buy a home. Over the last couple of years, many people wanted to make purchases, but the market wasnât perfect enough for them. Of course, rates during that period were lower than theyâd ever been, which equated to increased affordability. But were properties actually affordable?We were selling homes for 15% to 20% more than their list pricesâand thatâs outside the fact that we were listing some properties for more than what they were worth in the first place. So did low interest rates automatically make every property more affordable, or did everyone get caught up in a buying frenzy without focusing on the price they were truly paying?Back then, many buyers told us they wished there was more inventory and the competition wasnât so aggressive. Things were so heated that they couldnât view a property and then go home to sleep on their decisions. If they wanted a fighting chance at getting the home, theyâd have to submit their offers quickly and often for well above asking price. They werenât even getting counteroffers, which meant that other buyers were pulling even crazier stunts to win homes.âIf youâre waiting for the perfect time to buy a home, you may never actually do so.âIf rates decline to the 2% to 3% range again, weâd see the same type of market as we did a couple of years ago. Buyers would start gobbling up inventory and prices would skyrocket. In this new market, however, inventory is over 100% higher than it was in January of this year.Despite the increased inventory, weâre still in a sellerâs market, and rates are still historically low. That means you have many more options, less competition, and more time to process information so you can make wise decisions. Weâve even begun to see sellers offering buyer concessions, which we havenât seen in years. A buyer concession is when a seller offers to give the buyer a credit to buy down their interest rate.Hereâs the bottom line: We donât know what the future holds for the housing market, but if youâre waiting for the perfect time to buy a home, you may never actually do so. Take your emotions out of the equation and rely instead on the numbers and your personal motivation for purchasing a home. Speak with a lender to understand the true cost of homeownership, and remember that even if rates are higher than youâd like now, you can always refinance your mortgage if/when they come back down again.If you have any questions about whatâs going on in the housing market or youâre ready to buy a home, give me a call or send me an email. Iâd love to be a resource for you.",

        "content": "Sellers, the market isnât like it used to be. Focus on price and condition.If you want to sell your home quickly and for top dollar in todayâs market, its price and condition are hugely important. Today I want to discuss how to price your property appropriately given the current conditions of our housing market.Interest rates are over 100% higher than at their lowest point in 2021. Inventory in Orange County has increased by 200% since January to 3,500 available homes. Thatâs still 50% lower than this time in 2019, which was a low-inventory market.Even still, buyer demand is 35% lower than last year, and itâs hard to blame buyers for pumping the brakes. We went through two years of a low-rate environment, so now that theyâre twice as high, many buyers are questioning their decisions to make a purchase, which has contributed to a slowdown in the market. Though we are still in a strong sellerâs market where homes are selling for great prices, things arenât like they were just a year ago when you could list a home and sell it within a day for thousands over list price.âConsult with an expert and work to understand the trends in your local area when pricing your property.âTodayâs buyers are skeptical and nervous, so price and condition are critical to a successful home sale. The key is to price your home so that youâll attract the highest number of buyers. The more eyeballs you have on your property, the more offers youâll get, which translates into getting a higher price for your home.Keep in mind that Orange County is made up of several micro-markets, some of which are hotter than others. Values in some markets are still climbing, while others are staying flat or even declining. Consult with an expert and work to understand the trends in your local area when pricing your property. You might have to price your home slightly lower than your comparables if your market demands it.Â Thereâs still a lot of opportunity for sellers, but you need to focus on the right strategy, which comes from working with a strong listing agent in your area.

        "content": "In our shifting housing market, preparation is more important than ever. Are you ready for our changing housing market? Thereâs no question anymore that market conditions are shifting. If you arenât prepared, you could be setting yourself up for failure. The truth is that if you fail to plan, you end up planning to fail. Thatâs why today I want to explain why planning is crucial, especially now.Â A while back, some friends asked me if I wanted to do an Ironman competition with them. I thought it sounded like a great new opportunity, so the first thing I did was ask them what was included in the race. These triathlons included a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike ride, and a full marathon. This sounded incredibly difficult, but I knew that if I planned correctly, I could accomplish anything. Iâm proud to say that I completed the triathlon and became an Ironman this past weekend.âEvery minute you spend planning will save you 10 minutes down the road.âEntering this real estate market is no different than entering a difficult triathlon. Tons of buyers and sellers reach out and tell me that theyâre ready to make a move right this instant. When I explain that we need to prepare for a few weeks first, many of them are disappointed or frustrated. Itâs important to remember that every minute you spend planning will save you 10 minutes down the road. Buying or selling a home is one of the biggest financial decisions the average person makes in their lifetime. This is not something you want to rush.Â Preparation is key in any market, but our current one is in the middle of a big shift. Interest rates are rising quickly, and inventory is no longer at record lows. If you skip preparation and donât work with an expert real estate team, it could bite you later. Iâd love to work with you if you are making a move in Southern California, but I can also provide a referral if you are moving somewhere else.Â If you have questions about planning or anything else, please call or email me.

        "content": "Why you should explore your financing options in this shifting market.Are you keeping an open mind about your financing options? Today I want to talk to you about your options, but before I begin, itâs important for you to understand that I am not a lender. What Iâm telling you today are my opinions based on the client interactions I have daily. If youâre seriously interested in buying a property, you should connect with a lender and explore your financing options.What do I mean by exploring your options? A lot of our clients come to us and say that they want a 30-year fixed loan. Thatâs the safest type of loan, and they donât want to find themselves in hot water if the market suddenly changes.Â If thatâs your mindset and you can afford the payments on a 30-year fixed mortgage, by all means, get a 30-year fixed loan. However, as the market shifts and the interest rates rise, affordability will dramatically change. We had rates around 3% a few months ago, but now we have interest rates in the mid-5% range.When affordability changes, it becomes harder for people to pay for properties, so how will new buyers afford homes in our current market? The key is keeping an open mind. The average life of a loan is less than three years; it might even be less than two years. A couple of years ago, my lender said that the average homeowner sells or refinances their property within 1.8 years of buying. Most buyers are getting 30-year mortgages, but 99.9% of them will never pay off the whole 30-year life of their loan.Â Maybe you should talk to your lender about a seven- or 10-year adjustable-rate mortgage. Youâll have a fixed rate for a time, and after seven or 10 years, that rate will adjust. However, you probably wonât make it that far into the loan.âKeep an open mind about your financing options.âYou can also talk about interest-only loans. As the market gets more competitive, more loan programs will be offered to help buyers afford properties with the decreased affordability. If you look at the amortization schedule on most loans, youâre mostly paying interest for the first three to four years of a loan anyway. You would also always have the option to pay down your principal by paying a little extra every month.The bottom line is that the market is changing. Whether prices continue climbing, level out, or fall, homeownership is still a goal for many people. Itâs our job to help buyers find a way to buy regardless of the market. If youâre looking at the 30-year rates and thinking you canât afford a property, talk to your lender and consider different programs that can help you achieve your goal of homeownership.If you need a referral to an amazing lender or want a free, private, no-obligation consultation with us about what buying is like, please call or email us. Also, if you have any video ideas that youâd like me to cover in the future, send those my way as well. Iâd love to hear from you.",

        "content": "Why sellers canât expect instantaneous success in this market anymore.When it comes time to sell your property, donât expect instantaneous results. As the market shifts, inventory grows, rates rise, and demand falls, sellers must alter their strategies to sell their properties. These last few years, the market was appreciating aggressively. Sellers could name their price, and buyers were paying whatever it took to win.Â Steven Thomas writes in a recent housing report, âHomes that are overpriced, in poor condition, or in an inferior location, are going to be harder to sell, and will accumulate on the market. Sellers should no longer expect instantaneous success, which will become less likely as the year progresses and market items continue to rise.âÂ The bottom line is that interest rates are going up, and affordability is falling. Inventory is climbing, so buyers have more choices. Demand is also dropping. Thereâs a narrative out there stating that the market will crash. No one has a crystal ballânobody knows what will happen in the next 12 to 24 months. Many economists are predicting around 3% to 4% appreciation, while some people I trust expect a correction in two years. However, itâs all speculation.What we do know is that even though inventory is up over 150% from January, itâs still down 50% since 2019. Weâre still in a strong sellerâs market. The supply is so low that even though demand has fallen, there is still plenty for the right properties.Â We were even in a multiple-offer situation, recently. Our buyer was one of five who put an offer on the property, but how can that be the case when everyone is saying that the market is falling? With inventory still low, the best homes are still selling for amazing prices.Â âThereâs still plenty of demand for the right homes.âWhat does it mean to be one of the best homes? It means the home shows well, so you and your agent spent time transforming the property into a metaphorical model home. Maybe you went through the Robert Mack Groupâs five-point audit and addressed all the areas that we know create an emotional connection with buyers. This is the most important step.The second step to having one of the best homes is pricing it to attract the highest number of buyers. That doesnât mean you should price it at what you want it to sell for; our strategy is to price your home attractively so that enough buyers see the property, and we can create a multiple-offer scenario.If youâre a seller, you need to focus on having a great agent, showing your home like a model, and pricing it to attract the most qualified buyers. Thatâll help you sell your home for the most in a shifting market.If you found value in this video, please share it with someone.

How can you prevent this situation?Â The only way to make sure you donât get caught off guard by the home inspection is to have an inspection of your own. I know; it sounds a little weird. After all, why would you do the buyerâs job for them? However, there are many benefits to doing a pre-listing inspection:1. It helps you understand your property. You can decide which repairs you want to make before heading to the market.âPre-listing inspections help buyers make strong, confident offers. â2. If you donât want to fix something, you can disclose it. This way, your buyers know what theyâre getting into upfront and donât have an excuse to ask for concessions.Â 3. It gives the buyer more confidence. Many buyers are skeptical about what youâre hiding. If you include your inspection report, buyers will be reassured that they can make a strong offer.Â 4. It smooths over escrow. When buyers ask for repairs, they often try to renegotiate in escrow. This can create turbulence and even tank a sale. Without renegotiations, this process is easy.Â If you found value from todayâs topic, consider sharing it. Also, if you have any questions or video ideas, please call or email me.

Itâs difficult to look at things rationally and make the best decision by yourself, so today I want to talk about how you can sell your home like a pro with no emotion.Â The best thing you can do for your home sale is to treat your property like a product. I get it; youâve lived in your home for years, and it isnât just a building to you anymore. Itâs full of memories and completely integrated into your life. However, if you want to get top dollar and find a new home to make memories in, you need to let go of these emotions and understand that your property is a product.Â In my experience, three factors determine if youâll get top dollar for your home:Â 1. Preparation. The properties that sell for the highest and best prices are those that show like model homes. If you can stage your property with a professional designer, the return on your investment will be huge. This is because buyers buy based on emotion. If you can take your own emotions out of the transaction, you can appeal to your buyersâ emotions and get a fantastic deal.âYou need to let go of your emotions and understand that your property is a product.â2. Price. This is the bait you use to attract buyers. If you price your home correctly, buyers will want your property because itâs a great deal.

The more buyers see your home, the better. If you can move out of your house before listing, youâll be in a great position to get as many eyes as possible on your property.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs how buyers can get serious about winning a home in this market. Without a doubt, weâre in the middle of the most challenging market for buyers Iâve seen in my 16-year career. If you arenât in it to win it, youâll struggle to find a good home. How can you put in the effort to achieve your buying goals?Â First, letâs discuss the difference between easy things and difficult things. If you compare a half-mile walk to an Iron Man competition, itâs clear that the short walk is easier. Iron Man competitions are known for being hard, and people who compete in them know what theyâre getting into.Â Why do I bring this up? If youâre a buyer in todayâs market, you need to be like the competitors in an Iron Man competition. Prepare yourself for our market because if you donât, someone else will. Many buyers arenât taking things as seriously as they should be. For example, if you donât get pre-approved, someone who did will win your dream home.Â Itâs a lot of work, but itâs worth it so that you donât have to pay more in the future. Home prices are increasing, so if you take things easy for eight or nine months, your wallet will feel the impact.Â So what does it mean to get your act together? First, it means youâve spoken to a lender, you know exactly what your monthly payment will be, you know what type of loan youâre getting, and you know exactly what your price range is. In other words, youâve completely fallen in love with the numbers.Â âPrepare yourself for our market because if you donât, someone else will. âSecond, you have a solid relationship with an amazing real estate agent. This has to be someone who can get the job done, submit strong offers, and give you tough advice other agents wonât. When I work with my clients, I tell them that I may ask them to do things that make them extremely uncomfortable. However, I do this because I know what it takes to win in this tough market.Â Finally, when your agent gives you advice, please listen to them. I canât tell you how many times a buyer has come to me and said, âMy friend told me not to listen to you and do this other thing instead.â Every time, they come back to me later and tell me they wished they had listened in the first place. Your friends and family may mean well, but they probably arenât experts. In this market, an extra month or two looking for a home can mean spending a lot more money down the road. When your wallet is on the line, listen to the experts.Â I hope you get from my tone that this market is no joke. I just hate to see buyers lose money because they werenât serious from the beginning, so if youâre looking to purchase a home, please call or email my team. Weâd love to help you get real about winning.Â ",

Look, Iâm not saying that you should brush off the people you love and trust the most when it comes to buying or selling a home. However,Iâve seen many more friends and family members derail my clientsâ dreams and goals compared to those that helped. Everyone thinks theyâre an expertâthatâs the big problem.Â âWe have one of the best reputations in the country.âMany times, Iâll talk to a buyer or seller, give them my advice as a full-time real estate professional, then theyâll go against it based on the expert âadviceâ of a parent, co-worker, or friend who has a license. I always follow up with, âHow many homes has this person sold?â Nine times out of 10, the person isnât even in the industry. It blows my mind that someone would take advice from someone who isnât an expert.Â If you donât have experience in an industry, your advice means nothing. My team has the experience. We have one of the best reputations in the country.Just last week, a buyer called me reluctantly. They proceeded to tell me that they wished they would have bought the year before when I advised them to. Their dad told them not to buy, but that decision ended up pricing them out of the market. If they would have taken my advice, they would be riding this wave of appreciation right now.We told another client that they could bump up their sale price significantly with a little staging. We sold it for $30,000 less than we could have because they didnât want to stage based on advice from a friend who wasnât even in the industry. Iâm not saying you shouldnât listen to your friends and family or only listen to me, but keep an open mind. Trust the numbers, trust an expert, and letâs talk through your situation.Â If you have any questions, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Today weâll share our predictions about the upcoming year, but first, weâll need to discuss a few key components of the housing market: mortgage rates, home prices, and inventory.We expect to see mortgage rates go up at the beginning of 2022. Experts seem to agree that theyâll be around 3.3% at the start of the year and rise toward 3.7% by the end of 2022. Of course, no one has a crystal ball that lets them see the future, but we do know that rates tend to go up when things are going badly in the economy and go down when things are good.âWe expect to see mortgage rates go up at the beginning of 2022.âMany people are concerned about the home price forecast. Honestly, we expect more of what weâve seen in 2021, although not at the same rate. Home prices appreciated around 20% in 2021, give or take 5% or 10% depending on the area. Experts project anywhere between 5% to 7% appreciation year over year for 2022, though reports from Orange County suggest we may see 8% to 10%. Every area is different, and thatâs part of why itâs so important to partner with a real estate professionalâthey can help you navigate the complexities of the market.In terms of inventory, words like âcrisisâ and âcatastropheâ have been thrown around in 2021. In Orange County, we have somewhere around 1,200 homes on the market; back in 2019, we had over 7,500 at the peak of the market and around 4,000 around this time of year. Truth be told, the lack of inventory is the biggest challenge weâre facing in the market. Many buyers are struggling to find homes, and even sellers are having a hard time; they want to put their homes on the market for an amazing price, but theyâre just not confident theyâll be able to find another house to buy.If youâre planning to buy or sell a home in 2022 or have any questions about how market conditions will affect your goals, donât hesitate to reach out to us.

In my experience, itâs never too early to put together a strategy. The more time you spend preparing, the smoother the execution will be.Â If youâre looking to sell next year, itâs a great time to get together now and talk about your goals. Who do we need to put you in contact with now so that youâre more prepared when you are ready? If youâre a buyer, that might mean talking to a lender. If youâre a seller, you might want to talk to a designer or a contractor. With the year winding down, you have time to work on all of this.Again, remember to be grateful for everything good in your life.

One thing that Iâve learned in my life and career is that the more things we are grateful for, the more things weâll have to be grateful for.By that, I mean if you choose to focus on the things that arenât going well in your life, youâll continue to find things that arenât good in your life. Likewise, if you choose to focus on the things youâre grateful for, the more opportunities there will be in your life to show gratitude. In short, good things happen to happy people.Of course, Iâm grateful for my team and all the clients we serve. Iâm also grateful for the housing market and everything weâve been able to achieve in it over the last 16 years. With that, today I want to talk about gratitude as it relates to the consumer. Whether youâre thinking about buying or selling, gratitude can make a huge difference in your life.âBuyers and sellers who are grateful for the expert help they receive when they work with a fantastic, trustworthy agent tend to have a better all-around experience.âWe work with a good number of referral clientsâpeople who know, like, and trust us. However, we also meet a lot of people through social media who treat us with skepticism. They donât know us and might have their own prejudices about real estate agents. In my experience, Iâve noticed that the buyers and sellers who expect this process to be time-consuming, expect not to form a trusting relationship with their agents, or who believe their agent doesnât have their best interests in mind usually get exactly what they expect in the end.On the other hand, the clients who come in after being referred to us by a friend or family member or reading an online review and are ready to accept our expert advice on how to prepare for a home sale are generally the clients who come away satisfied. They understand that weâre the pros who know what weâre doing and that we know what it takes for them to win.All in all, the buyers and sellers who are grateful for the expert help they receive when they work with a fantastic, trustworthy agent tend to have a better all-around experience.If you have any questions about buying or selling property, donât hesitate to reach out to me via phone or email, and be sure to follow us on social media.

        "content": "Which is more important when buying a propertyâprice or cost?Many people, especially in the real estate industry, have a hard time wrapping their heads around the prices theyâre having to pay because the recent sales data doesnât support the values that are being offered. For example, I helped a client a few months back. We looked at a single-level property that was listed for $1.475 million. I ran the data and did my research, and I truly felt that given the tangible evidence, an appraiser could justify such a value for the home.Â Â The property had an oversized lot and it was fully renovated inside and out. The client didnât want to miss this opportunity, so I told her that I felt like most people would offer around $1.5 million for it, possibly more. If she wanted to wipe out her competition, I recommended that she offer $1.55 million. She just didnât know if she could pay that much.Rather than focusing on the price, I changed tack to focus instead on the cost of owning the property. We went back to the lender and ran the numbers at $1.55 million, and it turned out the cost was within her budget. I asked her how much more she thought she could reasonably afford; she said she probably had another $250 in her budget. We went back to the lender who said that an extra $250 a month translated to around $50,000 in purchase price, meaning that she could stand to offer $1.6 million.Â âDonât focus just on the price; focusing on the cost can open up more opportunities for you.âShe ended up submitting that offer and winning the bid. Now sheâs moved in and couldnât be more excited about the additional $100,000 in equity sheâs gained after just two months of being in the market.For another example, we had a client whose maximum approach price was $590,000, but she found a home that was listed for $620,000. We tried to find a way to increase the clientâs price but to keep the cost the same. After going back to the lender and reworking some numbers, we were able to get her offer from $590,000 to $610,000, which was significantly closer to the asking price, by asking for about $10,000 in credit. That would be used to buy down the interest rate so that her costs could stay the same. If we were just focused on price, that deal would have never come together, but because we were able to manipulate the price by focusing on the cost to create the illusion to the seller that they were getting more money, we were able to pull off that deal.Buyers: The bottom line is that youâre paying for premiums if youâre buying a home in todayâs market. Donât focus just on the price; focusing on the cost can open up more opportunities for you. At the end of the day, if youâre not paying cash, the monthly cost is more important to you anyway.If you have any questions about this or other real estate topics, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

We had it staged, it looked beautiful, and it was a hot home on Redfin. We knew that we were going to get multiple offers for it. When we held the open house, about 100 people came through on the first day. One person in particular stood out to me.This gentleman walked right up to me, got in my face, and asked how much commission I was offering. I wasnât sure why that was relevant since it was an open house, not an excuse to get into an argument about the commission. I told him I wasnât willing to discuss that right then, but he told me that he asked because he was already working with an agent but was willing to drop that agent to work directly with me if he could get a good deal.Thatâs where I drew the line. I told him that he wasnât the type of client I was trying to work with. I thought it was disrespectful, and if he was willing to ditch his agent at the drop of a dime just to get a better one, how could I know he wouldnât do the same to me?Iâm not looking to work with clients who arenât loyal. The people I like to work with are those who trust me and are committed to working with me and my team. I like people who are honest, transparent, and allow me to use my expertise to help them get what they want. I consider myself an expert, and the advice I give is extremely valuable.âDonât just approach a random agent to ask for a deal.âOn the other hand, if I had only been in the industry for a few years, I might be excited to have a conversation like that. Back then, I was selling only a few homes a year just trying to make a living. Any deal from any area wouldâve been valuable to me. However, Iâve been doing this for 16 years now, and I have a very strong book of business; we have many different lead generation sources that help us meet more people and create more visibility. We end up working with some amazing people.If youâre a consumer, itâs important to know who youâre talking to when you approach an agent. Are you talking to someone who has only been in the business for a short while or someone who has been in it for decades? In the end, the way that the gentleman approached me was just not the right way to communicate with someone who has been doing this for as long as I have.Though the type of market weâre in today is highly aggressive, people are still managing to buy the homes they love and take advantage of the appreciation. However, the buying process can be challenging, especially if youâre not working with an expert and just going to open houses to wheel and deal. If you want to set yourself up for success in this market, align yourself with a real estate expert who understands what youâre looking for and can help you through the process from beginning to end. Donât just approach a random agent to ask for a deal.If youâre thinking about buying a home and would like professional assistance, or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "Are you waiting for a better time to buy a home? Hereâs why you shouldnât.At the end of the day, no one in the real estate industry has a crystal ball. However, to all the buyers out there who are sitting on the sidelines waiting for a better time to buy, I can say this: Builders are out in the market building homes, and developers and hedge funds are out there buying properties, sometimes more than one at a time. These hedge funds have very smart people running all the numbers on the backend, and if they thought that the market was going to crash or take a turn anytime soon, they wouldnât be investing as much money as they currently are.I believe that we will see prices continue to rise for the next three to five years. Nothing suggests that weâre about to experience a bubble pop or a housing crash. What we do see, however, is slow appreciation over time.Â 2020 and 2021 have been bananas, but we expect 2022, 2023, and 2024 to chill out a little more. Instead of seeing 15% to 25% appreciation year over year, weâll instead see 4% to 6% over the next three to five years. Itâll be a much more normalized sellerâs market. So for all you buyers out there who are waiting for the market crash, you might be waiting for something thatâs not going to happen anytime soon.âNeglecting to explore your options because the news or your friends shared pessimistic views about the market is careless.âMany people donât understand that price is simply a one-time thingâinterest rates are what control your monthly payments. When I went online to use Zillowâs mortgage calculator recently, I typed in a $1 million property with a 20% down payment and a 3% interest rate. The monthly payment there was $4,478.Â Now, each time that the interest rate goes up by just 1%, home affordability falls by 10%. So I went back in the calculator and entered in a $900,000 property with a 20% down payment, but I increased the interest rate to 4%. The monthly payment became $4,442, which is only $36 less than the home that cost $100,000 more. That shows just how much interest rates can impact your monthly output.Here are a couple of other things to consider if you were planning to wait to buy:1. Will prices even fall by 10%? I donât think so. As Iâve said, property prices will likely continue to rise for the next three to five years.2. Interest rates will likely rise. If youâre planning to wait for a couple of years before buying, home prices could rise by 10% to 12%, but on top of that, interest rates could also rise, which would mean an exponential increase in your monthly payment.So ask yourself: Why are you planning to buy in the first place? If youâre buying to improve your quality of life, create space for your growing family, or increase your net worth, then you need to speak to a lender about what your monthly payment would be if you bought a home in a given price range. Start exploring your options instead of watching the news or listening to your friends, and stop worrying about all the chaos and confusion out there.If you have any questions about buying a home in todayâs market, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Hereâs how to find the best agent to help you sell your home.Have you ever heard of the Pareto Principle? It essentially states that 20% of the activities you do result in 80% of your results, and it applies to all facets of your life. Suppose youâre in a group of 10, and on average, two of those 10 people are doing 80% of the work. That means 80% of the people are doing 20% of the work.With that in mind, today I want to address the fact that you have a 68% chance of hiring the wrong agent when you list your property in Orange County. Why is that? Well, 68% of all agents in the county sell fewer than two homes each year. Also, almost 70% of homeowners interview only one agent and hire them on the spot to help them sell the most expensive asset they own. Itâs mind-blowing!So what can you do to ensure youâre hiring an expert to help you sell your home, one who will get you what you want while reducing as much of the friction as possible? First, let me ask you a question: If you had to get Lasik eye surgery, would you want to work with a doctor who only does one or two procedures a year or one who does hundreds or thousands a year? If youâre like me, youâd want to work with a doctor whoâs done it before many times and achieved great results. With someone who only does it a couple of timesâwho knows what the outcome would be?âYou donât want to trust the sale of your most expensive asset to a novice.âFor the prospective sellers who are looking for an agent to help them make the best decisions, here are four questions that youâll want to ask any agent you interview for the job:1. âHow many homes have you sold in the last 12 months?â Their answer will tell you how many transactions they do. The more homes they sell, the more they learn, and the better their clientsâ experiences become.2. âWhatâs your list-to-sales price ratio?â Agents will list a property at a certain price and sell it either above or below that point. Asking this question will help you understand what the agent might sell your property forâis it likely to sell for more or less than your list price? My team will have sold about 65 homes this year, and our average list-to-sale price ratio is around 104%, meaning that on average, we sell homes for 4% more than what we listed it for originally.3. âHow fast do you sell homes?â Are you working with an agent who sells homes in an average of a month, two months, three months? Or are you working with an agent who sells homes within just days of listing? This is all great information to obtain because understanding how long the process will take will let you plan ahead.4. âHow will you get me what I want?â When I speak with a seller, I ask them a series of questions to learn more about what they need from their sale, and then I build a customized strategy to get them exactly what they want. Often, that includes online and offline marketing, home preparation, pricing strategies, or even collaborating with agents in other areas.These are all important questions to ask any agent because the barrier for entry into the real estate industry is very low, and you donât want to trust the sale of your most expensive asset to a novice. If you have any questions or are thinking about selling your home, reach out to me. Iâd love to be a resource and help you make the best decisions moving forward.",

        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs what buyers need to know about the state of our market.Is this a bad time to buy? I was working with a buyer the other day who sent me a Facebook post claiming it was a bad time to buy for a variety of reasons. Real estate is never a one-size-fits-all business, so today I want to go over every point in the post and talk about our market for buyers in general:1. Homes are overpriced. Whether or not a home is overpriced is a matter of perspective. You are certainly paying a premium for a home, but to a lot of buyers, itâs worth the cost.Â 2. PMI is high in our current market. This one is true, but is it a dealbreaker? The real question is what will your monthly payment look like, and with low interest rates, you can lock in a great rate.Â 3. Interest rates are fake because they are front-loaded in your loan. Iâm not sure I would call the rates fake, but it is true that lenders tend to save the principle for the end of your loan. So if you have a 30-year mortgage, youâll probably pay off all the interest in the first 10 years.Â This all sounds pretty bad, but let me give you some counterpoints:First, It doesnât matter if you buy now or later â lenders wonât change how they set their loans. So if youâre waiting for a time when you donât have to pay interest upfront, it will probably never come. Also, you can always make extra payments earlier in the life of your loan. We always recommend our buyers do this to decrease the overall cost of their mortgage.Â â You should always talk to a lender before you buy. âSecond, If you stay within your comfort zone, you wonât be overleveraged. You donât need to worry about PMI as long as you budget correctly and have a good grasp of your situation. This is part of the reason why talking to a lender is so important. Theyâll let you know exactly what your situation is.Â Now that Iâve addressed some of the negative critiques, I want to offer you some positive reasons why now is still a good time to buy:1. Renting is a waste of money. Mortgages are almost always lower than rents. Youâre paying to live somewhere anyway, so you might as well take advantage of appreciation while youâre at it.Â 2. Homeownership builds equity over time. The market is expected to be good for a while, so this is a great opportunity to increase your net worth.Â 3. There are huge tax benefits to homeownership.Â 4. You will always pay interest upfront. Once again, if you are waiting for the magical time when lenders will forgo this practice, it isnât coming.Â 5. Prices will not fall anytime soon. Our market continues to be hot, and there are no signs of a crash. If you are waiting for prices to drop, you could be waiting for a very long time.Â 6. Homeowners almost always have a higher net worth than renters. This is just common sense. When you rent, you canât take advantage of appreciation.Â There are endless numbers of reasons to buy a home, but Iâll stop things there. At the end of the day, the benefits of homeownership are too good to pass up, so if you are looking to buy, please call me. My team and I are always willing to help.Â ",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": " If your buyer isnât performing, a notice to perform is a great option. Is your buyer not performing? Letâs talk about it.Â As you may know, when you go under contract with a buyer, certain contingencies are usually in place. These include things like the inspection contingency, the appraisal contingency, and the loan contingency. In a typical market, you take some time with the buyer to hammer these things out. However, our market has become so competitive that the time frame is shortened. This means inspections are being done in just five or 10 days. Appraisals are sometimes being removed. Some buyers are waiving the loan contingency to make their offer stand out.Â In this fast-paced market, a lot can go wrong. Letâs say you and your buyer have agreed to a seven-day inspection period, thereâs no appraisal, and the loan period is 14 days. Once the seller accepts this offer, the only party who can cancel things is the buyer. The only way the seller can cancel the transaction is if the buyer is not performing.Â âTwo days is an eternity in our market.âFor example, if the previous agreementâs loan period passes after 14 days and the buyer still hasnât held up their end, you can send them a notice to perform. If the buyer does not respond within the agreed-upon timeframe for this notice to perform, you can cancel the contract. When I first started in real estate, a notice to perform was just one day, but now itâs two.Â Keep in mind that it doesnât matter what time of day you send the notice to perform. No matter when you send your notice on a Wednesday, your buyer has until Friday at 11:59 p.m. Sometimes, two days is an eternity in our market. Thatâs why I recommend trying to shorten the notice period to one day if you are selling your home.Â If you have any questions about todayâs video, or if you have any topics you want me to talk about, please reach out to me.

        "content": "Hereâs everything you need to know about rising cancelations from buyers. Are cancelations on the rise? If youâre looking to sell, cancelations are something you should be thinking about, so today Iâll tell you everything you need to know about them.Â First off, if youâve been following my videos, you know that the market has been white-hot. Inventory is historically low, and we have an influx of buyers driving high demand. If a home comes on the market priced correctly, itâs basically an auction among buyers.Â For example, we listed a property last week that has 27 offers after five days. It became so crazy, we had to stop accepting offers just to wrap our heads around everything. However, on that same property, we had three cancelations.Â â If you find a highly motivated buyer, they may be willing to raise their price, and they are far less likely to cancel.âLet me explain. Buyers are understandably frustrated right now. I recently spoke to an agent whose client missed out on 11 properties before we accepted their offer. Buyers are coming in hot and emotional. Sometimes, they make an offer they arenât totally comfortable with just because theyâre so sick of losing. Once their offer is accepted, they begin to have buyerâs remorse. Next thing you know, you have a cancelation on your hands.Â As agents, we try to vet your buyers the best we can. However, Iâve been hearing across my team that cancelations are on the rise. If you watched my last video, you know our process for finding the best buyer. The important thing to remember is that price is not always the most important thing to look for in an offer.Â For sellers, I have a few questions you should keep in mind when accepting an offer:Â   Do they have a good agent?  Are they motivated?  Are their finances in order?Â   Do they have a good lender?Â When so many offers are coming in, itâs tempting to focus on the top two highest prices to narrow things down. However, I recommend taking the time to vet some buyers with lower initial offers. If you find a highly motivated buyer, they may be willing to raise their price, and they are far less likely to cancel.Â If you have questions about todayâs topic, or if you have any future video ideas, please reach out to me via phone or email.

        "content": "Hereâs my process for determining the right price for every buyerâs offer. If youâve been paying attention to the market, then you know weâre living through an unprecedented sellerâs market. When demand is high and supply is low, it can be hard for buyers to break through and get a home they love. Today, I want to discuss how much buyers should be offering to win the home of their dreams.Â How high your offer should be is different for every buyer, but it always comes down to a few factors:First, how much money are you willing to spend? I donât know how much you want any given home. Buyer motivation is a key aspect of real estate no matter which side of the table youâre sitting on. If you are a buyer, Iâll go over how to determine your motivation shortly.Â Second, how much are competing buyers willing to spend? This factor is unknowable. I can give you an estimate based on the quality of the home and what I think it should sell for, but itâs still just an estimate.âYou donât want to feel like you left something on the table or overplayed your hand.âSo there are a lot of unknowns in determining an offerâs price. However, we still manage to come up with a number. Let me explain my three-step process for determining price:1. How much do you want the home? I always ask my clients to give me a number from one to 10. This is a good benchmark to start with.Â 2. How desperate are you? Once again, I ask my clients to give me a number from one to 10. One means youâve just started looking, and you wouldnât be devastated if you lost the home. 10 means youâve been searching for months and this is the 11th property youâve made an offer on.Â 3. What is your financial situation? For finances, a one would mean the home is way outside your price, while a 10 means you can go a bit over list price.Â Together, weâll work to create an offer that fits your circumstances. Too often, I see people try and predict what other buyers will try and do, but this can easily lead to making an offer outside your price range.Â There are a lot of buyers with a 10 in desperation but not necessarily a 10 in motivation or finances. No matter what happens with your offer,Â  itâs important that you donât feel like you left something on the table or overplayed your hand. You want to make an offer that fits your situation above all other considerations.Â There is no one-size-fits-all approach to real estate in this market. If you hire an expert, they can help create a personalized approach that works for you.

By that, I mean that your home hasnât sold until escrow closes, and lots of things have to happen during the escrow period for the transaction to be completed successfully. To help ensure you make it to closing, you need to find a good buyer.Around 20% to 30% of escrows are falling apart, and itâs happening for a variety of reasons: buyerâs remorse, inability to qualify, and appraisal problems, to name a few. However, there are four things your agent can to do help you find the right buyer and minimize the chances of your escrow collapsing:1. Look for buyer motivation: Committed, motivated buyers will be willing to navigate the stressful parts of the escrow process. Those who arenât motivated may simply pull out when things get tricky.2. Find out buyer financing: The buyer should be fully pre-approved; if theyâre paying cash, their funds need to be accessible to avoid any delays. Additionally, itâs good to find out if the buyer will be able to cover any potential appraisal gaps.âLots of things have to happen during the escrow period for the transaction to be completed successfully.â3.

        "content": "Hereâs what you need to know about waiving appraisal contingencies.In todayâs market, buyers are doing all they can to make their home offers stand out. This includes waiving contingencies, and today Iâd like to talk about one that many buyers seem to have some misgivings about: the appraisal contingency.Regardless of what kind of market youâre in, itâs important to know your finances. If you know your finances and can afford to cover an appraisal gap, you shouldnât be afraid of removing an appraisal contingency. Each home has an appraised value and a market value. For the appraised value, appraisers assign homes a value based on past comparable home sales. However, prices are rising so quickly that itâs been hard for appraisers to justify the prices buyers are paying now. So, thereâs a gap between the appraised value and the market value.Letâs say youâre buying a $1 million property and youâre pre-approved for a 20% down conventional loan. This means the lender will give you 80% of your homeâs value as a loan. Now, letâs say the home appraises for $900,000 but you offered $1 millionâthereâs a $100,000 gap, and theyâll only give you 80% of the $900,000. You have to come in with an additional $100,000 down to cover the gap.âPrices are rising so quickly that itâs been hard for appraisers to justify the prices buyers are paying now.âIf you have the money to cover this gap, youâll increase your down payment and reduce your loan volume, which lowers your monthly payment. So, talk to your lender and see how much additional money you could use on a gap. You could even use tools like PMI or SPMI if you donât have enough money to cover a gap. By doing either of these things, you can confidently waive your appraisal contingency and win the home of your dreams.If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "You want to take some time to vet buyers before selling your home.Weâre in a blazing-hot market right now, and itâs incredibly easy for sellers to make a fantastic profit on their home sale. However, Iâve seen that some are pulling the trigger a little too quickly and unintentionally causing the deal to fall apart, so today Iâd like to talk about the approach sellers should be taking.Weâre seeing a lot more canceled escrows than usual, and itâs due to things like buyerâs remorse, problems with qualifying, and more. A lot of this is happening because things are going so fast, and hereâs an example of how it occurs: Letâs say a home is listed on Thursday. The seller and their agents will have showings over the weekend and ask for all offers to be submitted by Monday at noon. This sometimes works but sometimes doesnât.More important than the buyerâs offer, price, and terms is the buyerâs motivation. You want to be sure that theyâre willing to close the transaction, regardless of what happens in escrow. You want to be sure theyâre financially qualified to buy and that their lender is responsive and can make things happen when problems arise. The buyerâs agent is also important to considerâif theyâre inexperienced, a lot of issues can pop up in escrow.Â âDonât be so eager to accept an offer right away and lock yourself in; instead, do your due diligence and cover your bases.âWhen weâre choosing a buyer, weâre looking at everythingâpricing, terms, motivation, financing, lenders, and agents. When you sell a home over a weekend, itâs impossible to adequately research all these different variables.I understand the excitement of getting a great offer, but itâs incredibly important to make sure the transaction wonât fall apart. Donât be so eager to accept an offer right away and lock yourself in; instead, do your due diligence and cover your bases. By waiting, youâre also giving your listing more time to attract the perfect buyer later in the week.If youâre ready to sell your home or if you have any questions about our market, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "Instead of looking for your dream home, you may want to consider other options.Itâs no secret that buyers are having a difficult time finding homes in todayâs market. Prices have skyrocketed due to high demand and low inventory, and it seems like the problem just keeps growing. Buyers are constantly asking me about what they can do to win without paying tens of thousands of dollars more than what a home is worth, so letâs talk about some strategies.In past videos, Iâve discussed how to find unknown or âcoming soonâ homesâeveryone flocks to the brand new listings, after all. You can look at homes that have sat on the market for a while, homes that are overpriced, or homes that need some repairs. Instead of searching for a move-in ready home, you might want to consider taking the ânon-dream homeâ approach.Hereâs an example: I had clients who lived in a one-bedroom apartment for years, and then theyâd committed themselves to buying a three-bedroom home. There were options out there, but my clients quickly realized they were getting priced out of the market due to rapid appreciation. They decided theyâd stay in their apartment, save up, and try again in a year or two.â Instead of searching for a move-in ready home, you might want to consider taking the ânon-dream homeâ approach.âUnfortunately, the marketâs moving so fast that itâs incredibly difficult to save as fast as homes are appreciating. People who wait could find themselves in a similar or even worse situation down the road. So, I spoke with my clients and explained their situationâtheyâre already willing to live in a one-bedroom apartment, so why not look for a one- or two-bedroom home instead? Itâs not ideal, but it allows them to have a better quality of life, take advantage of appreciation, and earn equity in the coming years. Then they could leverage their equity into finally buying the home of their dreams.Hereâs the big question of the day: Are you willing to rework your home buying goals, or are you going to give up on having a home entirely?Â If youâd like to learn more about finding a home in todayâs market, or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

        "content": "What is the shelf life of your listing?The market is absolutely crazy right nowâhomes are selling for prices that shock even me, inventory is lower than Iâve ever seen it, and interest rates are still historically low, making affordability higher. And, due to the influx of 50 million+ millennial buyers in the market, we simply have too many buyers and not enough homes to meet demand. These conditions have caused many to be concerned that weâre in a housing bubble. In truth, itâs not a bubble but rather simple economics.As the market improves, weâre starting to see more optimistic sellers. If they donât get the price they wanted right off the bat, theyâll drop the price in a few weeks and attempt to get it again. In reality, weâre seeing the exact opposite happening.The market is scorching hot, so if a great home goes live and is priced correctly, that listing will generate a bidding war which will, in turn, help it sell for a record price. That said, if you overprice your property and it doesnât sell within two or three weeks, buyers will stop caring about the listing. Unless you do a dramatic price drop, youâre not going to get the activity you want.âThis market may be hot, but buyers arenât stupid.âIf your listing isnât getting any showings, then that means youâre probably 7% to 10% overpriced or more. If youâre getting a lot of showing activity but youâre not getting any offers, youâre probably 3% to 5% overpriced.The biggest problems we see with sellers who overprice their homes are twofold:1. They donât drop their prices enough. For example, if youâre 3% to 5% overpriced and you only drop the price by 1% or 2%, that might not be enough to get anyoneâs attention.Â 2. They donât drop their prices soon enough. Usually when we list a new property, we have a two-week window where weâre pushing to sell the property for the best price. By week two, if we donât have any prospects, then weâll have a conversation with the seller to drop the price by 3% to 5% to keep the buyers interested in it.The bottom line is that this market may be hot, but buyers arenât stupid. If you overprice your property too much, youâre flirting with the possibility of your listing going stale.On our team, weâre experts at marketing homes and getting them ready to sell for the best price in two weeks or fewer.

That means in todayâs market, sellers are in the driverâs seat.To succeed as a buyer in this fierce environment, you may have to remove your appraisal contingencies because the appraiser may not justify the value that youâre paying. Sometimes, sellers want rent-back agreements, which will cost you money, especially if the rent-back is free. You might also have to bid higher than you want to pay to secure a home. Many things are happening in todayâs market that werenât going on even just months ago. That has created a high level of emotional uncertainty for buyers. They look at all the things that theyâll need to do to have a chance at competing in multiple-offer situations and realize with dismay that those things will cost them a lot of money.âFall in love with the numbers before you fall in love with the house.âThe truth is that most people donât have an intimate knowledge of exactly what itâs going to take for them to buy their next house, whether that be how much theyâll need to bring in, what their maximum purchase price is, or what their monthly payment will be.Â Before we even start the home-buying process, we tell our buyers to fall in love with the numbers before they fall in love with the home. Especially in todayâs market where there are so many different added costs to buying a house, people tend to freak out a little. However, if youâve fallen in love with the numbers first, it doesnât have to be so stressful. Talk to a lender or two to gain an understanding of what your financial output is going to be so that when you fall in love with the house, thereâs no doubt about whether or not you can afford it.No matter if youâre looking to buy a home now or in a few years, Iâd love to be a resource for you.

        "content": "This is why your mindset is everything in the current housing market.As you know, inventory is historically low. There has been some increase over the past couple of weeks because weâve hit the spring market, which is when we typically see 5% to 7% more homes on the market than usual. Still, that inventory isnât lasting long enough to make a real impact. Homes are selling very quickly; the average days on market for homes under $1.5 million is between 14 and 20 days (and many times even less). In the luxury market above $1.5 million, homes are taking a bit longer to sell, but if theyâre priced right and look good, they typically sell within 30 to 45 days.Since homes are selling so quickly, buyers wonât see the relief theyâre looking for until a lot more homes hit the market. We donât anticipate that happening in 2021, meaning we can expect a strong sellerâs market for the foreseeable future. Demand for homes is higher than ever.Â Interest rates have been fluctuating; theyâre currently hovering around 3%, and some buyers are still able to lock in rates in the 2s. It all depends on your financial situation, credit, and the type of loan youâre getting. If youâd like more information about interest rates, we can connect you to some of the best lenders in Orange County.âBuyers need to go outside their comfort zone if they want to win the property they love.âFor those who are thinking about selling, I encourage you to revisit the video I made a few weeks ago about the importance of home preparation.Â Many sellers are eliminating that portion of the process because they think that since the market is hot, they can just list their homes and theyâll automatically sell. However, I believe that home preparation is grossly underrated. If youâre looking to sell for the very best price, now is the time to leverage home preparation, staging, and design to maximize your outcome.For buyers, holding the right mindset is everything. The difference between those who are successful and those who are less so is the commitment to winning. Right now, buyers have to have the killer instinct to win at all costs, especially if they want to buy a property that fits all their criteria. Iâve made dozens of videos about tips to help buyers win, so be sure to review my blog or YouTube channel to learn what it takes to write a winning offer.Â You need to trust your agent and follow their advice if you want to get the job done. Though there are many safety nets within a transaction to protect you, youâll still need to go outside your comfort zone if you want to win the property you love.Whether youâre buying or selling, if you have any questions at all, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

In the case of preparing to sell a home, preparation might involve making repairs, replacing carpets, painting the walls, and even professional staging.The reason why the prep work is so important is that buyers make their purchases based on emotion. When you prepare your home and make it look bright, inviting, and full of possibilities, buyers will be able to see themselves living there. Theyâll see how they can grow, how they can make memories, and what kind of life theyâll be able to have.We actually spend more time on preparing homes than we do marketing themâthatâs how much of a difference it makes. However, itâs not something that everyone loves to do. Most sellers want to net the most they can on their sale, so they think, âWhy should I spend $5,000 on preparing my home if Iâm just going to sell it?â Well, to get top dollar, the buyer needs to see a top-quality home. For the seller, that means investing some time and money into the home in order to amplify a buyerâs emotions.âIf you want to squeeze every cent of equity out of your home, preparation is a no-brainerâespecially in our current market.âWith todayâs blazing-hot housing market, though, itâs now even more difficult for sellers to get behind the idea. After all, a seller can list their home and be almost guaranteed a sale. However, these homes arenât selling for record-high pricesâthe ones that are have been fully prepared and stand out. Typically, these prepped homes bring in 3% to 5% more on the sale.If you want to squeeze every cent of equity out of your home, preparation is a no-brainerâespecially in our current market.

Every new listing is bombarded with offers, meaning most buyers are walking away empty-handed. After going through this same cycle over and over, it can easily become discouraging.Donât lose hope just yet, though. There are still a few ways that buyers can winâeven in a blazing-hot sellerâs market like ours. Most buyers are focusing their attention on the new homes that come onto the market, so youâll need to know how to make your offer stand out among the rest. Hereâs how:Â 1. Submit a great first offer. If you submit something low and leave room to negotiate, you may not get the opportunity to increase your price. Sellers arenât countering every offerâtheyâre usually only focusing on the top two or three buyers. Other times, they just pick the best one immediately. So, to get your foot in the door, you need to submit your best offer upfront.2. Find out what terms the seller wants. For example, you want to learn how long of an escrow period they want. You want to write an offer with terms that attract the sellerâyou might shorten contingency periods or remove appraisal contingencies to strengthen your offer. If you remove the appraisal contingency, show the seller you have the money to pay the difference.3. Be flexible. In the past, buyers and sellers would arrange leasebacks that let the seller pay to live in the home while they search for a new one. Now, buyers are letting the sellers stay without paying. Theyâre doing this just to ensure they can get into the home. If youâre going to offer a leaseback, do so for free or at a discounted price.âTo get your foot in the door, you need to submit your best offer upfront.âIf youâre sick of competing, you can take a different approach. Essentially, it involves keeping an open mind about what youâre looking for. You might find a better option or price in an area you werenât considering before, or perhaps a smaller house would still work well for your needs. Start focusing on broadening your search and removing some of your expectations. You can also look for stale listings that have sat unsold on the market. Typically, thereâs something keeping these homes from selling, and the sellers may be getting desperate. If the home has an issue you can overlook, you might find yourself a fantastic deal.Â If you have any questions or would like more information about how to win in todayâs market, feel free to reach out to us.

        "content": "Hereâs a look at what the future might hold for our housing market.Right now, weâre used to being in a scaldingly hot sellerâs market. If you put a home on the market, youâre going to get multiple offers and receive more than your asking price. And due to fierce competition, buyers are doing everything they can to get their offers noticed and accepted.Â What goes up must come down, however, and the market may soon begin to normalize somewhat. Iâm not talking about things turning into a buyerâs market, but we do anticipate a shift in the near future. There are a few reasons why.Inventory is still historically low, but more homes begin to come onto the market for the spring selling season in April, May, June, and July. Even now, weâre seeing more and more listings pop up. When inventory increases, demand usually decreases a bit.Â Additionally, interest rates are beginning to rise. Weâve enjoyed incredibly low interest rates of around 2.5% for a while, but theyâre now closer to about 3.25%. When rates go up a half percent, affordability falls by approximately 6%, so these increases have forced some buyers out of the market. As rates continue to rise, more and more buyers will have to drop out. As a result, supply will likely increase and demand will decrease.âDonât let the last few months determine how you price your home going forward.âInterest rates change with world conditions, meaning that as things become more certain, rates increase. Weâve had stimulus checks, business openings, a better economy, vaccines, and more of a general return to normalcy. Since things are mostly improving, interest rates will likely settle around 3.5% to 4% by the end of the year.With more homes on the housing market and higher interest rates, buyers are going to have more options to choose from. Sellers will need to be extra careful when it comes to pricing their homes, as there simply wonât be the same level of competition and demand among buyers. Buyers will be able to be a bit pickier when looking at homes, so youâll need to price yours effectively.Donât let the last few months determine how you price your home going forward. Your price is essentially the baitâif you price your home too high, youâll scare a lot of potential buyers away. However, even if you think you know what your home should be priced at, itâs always in your best interest to work with a seasoned professional when selling.Â You want a Realtor who has worked through the drastic changes that occur within the market, as they understand how to gauge what buyers are looking for and how you can appeal to them.

        "content": "The super-hot sellerâs market may be shifting  toward buyers right now.The last three to four months have been difficult for buyers hoping to jump into the housing market. Demand for homes has been incredibly high, but there are few homes available. This has meant buyers are having a tough time finding homes, and itâs been even harder to beat the fierce competition and secure a sale. It hasnât been uncommon to see anywhere from 10 to 30 or more offers on properties, and needless to say, buyers are getting frustrated.Â Fortunately, I have some good news. A few things have happened recently that have been contributing to the economy. First of all, most people have received their stimulus checks. More and more businesses are also beginning to open up, and many are thriving. Interest rates have crept up a little bit, but this is usually indicative of a return to normalcy.Â In our last video, we talked about key indicators of the housing market. One was inventory, which is still historically low. The other is interest rates, which have risen from around 2.75% to around 3.25%; keep in mind that every time rates increase by 0.5%, affordability decreases by about 6%. We believe interest rates will be around 4% by the end of the year.âThereâs a light at the end of the tunnel, buyers, but it comes at the cost of affordability.âHistorically, weâve seen inventory rise in April, May, June, and July. With interest rates also rising, it should begin taking longer for listings to sell. With these factors combined, we should see more available inventory, which should give buyers more opportunities and options to find a home.Â The main takeaway for buyers is that relief is coming in the next month or two, and the hot sellerâs market may end within the next four to six months. Itâs not going to shift to a buyerâs market, thoughâitâs just going to be more reasonable than what weâve been seeing. Homes wonât appreciate by 1% to 2% each month; instead, theyâll appreciate around 4% to 6% year over year.Thereâs a light at the end of the tunnel, buyers, but it comes at the cost of affordability.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "These strategies will help sellers transition between homes.How are our sellers transitioning in this housing market?First, let me put things into perspective. The reason weâre talking about this is that inventory is historically low. There are actually more buyers in our market than we have homes for sale. When a great property pops up and itâs priced to sell, weâre seeing a swarm of buyers attack it and do whatever it takes to get it. This is creating challenges for sellers because those who have to sell then buy are having trouble finding a replacement property. Many of them donât want to put their homes on the market because they wonât have anywhere to go after they sell. This is the bottleneck effect weâve been dealing with for the past three or four months. Thus, weâve come up with specific ways to help our sellers transition:1. The rent-back. In the past, for sellers transitioning, weâd asked for a moving timeline of a month or two. Nowadays, sellers are asking for whatever they need. Sometimes itâs a month or two, sometimes itâs three to six months, sometimes itâs up to a year. Regardless of what strategy you use, there will always be pros and cons.A shorter rent-back will be open to more buyers, while a longer rent-back will limit the number of people who can actually accommodate that rent-back. Sometimes with a rent-back, you pay the buyer the cost of owning the property. Other times, itâs a discounted rate. With how aggressive the market is, weâre seeing a lot of buyers let sellers have a free rent-back for however long they need in order to sweeten the deal.2. Contingent sale. As a seller, you can list your property, field offers, and accept an offer contingent upon finding another place. Basically, you negotiate a certain amount of time with the buyer to find another place so both escrows can be done at the same time. If you canât find a place, though, the deal is off and youâre not selling. That creates certainty for our seller, but not so much for the buyer. Again, there are pros and cons.âRegardless of which of these strategies you use, there will always be pros and cons.â3. The staycation. Letâs say you sell your property and negotiate a rent-back timeline to ease into your transition. Then, you can hire a pod company to take all your stuff, move it to their storage facility, and then rent an Airbnb for three to six months. There are a lot of them out there that come fully furnished and allow you to negotiate many different terms. This allows you to have a vacation from your normal life while youâre looking for your next property. Itâs a fun way to create a short-term transitionary period without having to move all your things twice.4. A short-term rental. You can go to the Irvine Company, any type of apartment community, or even find a private-party landlord and request to rent their property for six months.5. Buy first, then sell. Iâd say only about 10% of our buyers and sellers have the ability to do this. After you move everything into your new home, you can sell your property as a vacant one. This is the best way to sell a property, but again, many sellers canât do it.If youâre looking to sell your current home and buy another property and are worried about the transition, my team has a solution for you.

        "title": "6 Reasons to Get Pre-Approved Today",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are six reasons you should get pre-approved right now.Whether you just decided you want to buy a home or have been thinking about it for a while, or whether you want to buy now or see yourself buying in three to five years, you need to get pre-approved today. There are six reasons why:1. It provides education and options. When you talk to a lender and open your financial scenario to them, theyâll let you know what kind of loans you qualify for, how much you can afford, what your monthly payment will be, how much youâll have to bring to the closing table, whether or not thereâs any free money out there for you, etc. Understanding all of your options and getting educated about your loan will set you up for success.2. It buys you time. Most of the buyers my team and I meet with donât say, âIâm ready to go right now.â Instead, they tell us theyâre thinking about buying, they want to learn more about what that looks like, and are curious what their next step should be. They may be looking to sell six or even 12 months down the road, but getting pre-approved now and understanding their financial situation gives them time to structure their loan, make any adjustments in their personal life, and clear up any blemishes in their credit report. Having time on your side is crucial!3. It gives you insight into the three key indicators (as alluded to in point No. 1). The first of these is your monthly payment: If you buy a home for x amount of dollars, how much will your monthly payment be? The second is how much you qualify for (i.e., your total purchase price). One of my mentors once told me that purchase price is a one-time thing; your monthly payment is what you need to be focused on. Thatâs why the market is moving so quickly right nowâinterest rates are historically low.The third indicator is how much money you need to bring to the table. Are there grants you can take advantage of? How much are your closing costs? These indicators are things youâll want to know before embarking on the home-buying process. As Dave Ramsey says, âFall in love with the numbers before you fall in love with the house.ââUnderstanding all of your options and getting educated about your loan will set you up for success.â4. The âjust in case.â A lot of our clients get pre-approved knowing they want to buy in six to 12 months, but all of a sudden a beautiful home gets listed in their price range and convinces them that they canât pass it up. The fact that they got pre-approved right when they thought about buying puts them in a position to buy that unicorn property that popped up out of the blue. You need to be ready to strike at a momentâs notice in a market like this.5. It may be required of you. Due to COVID, many homeowners are requiring buyers to send their pre-approvals up front. They donât want just anybody walking through their home. They only want to allow access to those buyers who can afford their property. This doesnât mean every home, but I estimate that 30% to 40% of all sellers are making this stipulation. Just having it allows you to go out and look at more homes. Even if youâre not ready to buy, you still have your admission ticket if a home pops up that you like and want to see.6. Itâs completely free. There are no commitments or obligations. Itâs simply an educational experience that will leave you feeling much more empowered to make the right decision.If youâre thinking of buying a home or have more questions about this topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "Buyers: Donât Let FOMO Cost You Money",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Donât let FOMO guide your decision-making process as a homebuyer.Is FOMO costing you money? FOMO stands for the âfear of missing out.â If you havenât heard of this term, Google it; itâs a real thing.Â The bottom line is that my team and I work with a lot of buyers, and these buyers come in all shapes and sizes. 50% of them are focused on what they want. They know the area theyâre looking in, understand why theyâre buying, and have fallen in love with the numbers. What I mean by that last part is theyâve spoken with a lender, understand the loan theyâre getting and how much theyâll bring to the table for a down payment, know what their monthly payment and closing costs will be, etc. Theyâre 100% ready to go; all theyâre waiting for is the right property to pop up.Â The other 50% we work with are playing small. Theyâve spoken to a lender but donât understand their financial options. Theyâve spoken to an agent or two but havenât developed a relationship with them. They have a general idea of where they want to live but arenât committed to a particular area. They donât know why they want to buy, they just know that now is a good time to do so.Â Weâve found that the people who are focused, ready, and prepared are winning. The people who donât know whatâs going on financially, emotionally, or physically are the ones who have a lot of doubt, and that doubt is costing them tons of money in our market. In short, they have FOMO. They have FOMO because they donât know what they want.Â For example, they might find a property, fall in love with it, and want to submit an offer. However, as soon as two other properties they like come on the market in a completely different area, theyâll decide they want to look at those properties before moving forward with their first offer. At that point, theyâre comparing apples and oranges. Most buyers look for 10/10 homes, but unless you have an unlimited budget or are building a custom home, itâs difficult to find a 10/10 home. My team and I encourage our clients to look for 7/10 or 8/10 homes because that will give them what they want and allow them to work around the rest as they settle into the property.âUnderstand why youâre buying, where you want to live, and then zero-in on that area.âThe point is, the buyer who wants to submit an offer on one property while looking at two others will get even more confused. Theyâll miss out on the initial home they wanted, and by the time they feel like they want to submit offers for the other two homes, multiple other buyers will have already made offers on them. Thus, they get caught up in these bidding wars but never close the loop because theyâre not even sure what they want. They keep letting other properties distract them, and all the while the market is moving very aggressively. When one home sells, the next one is selling for more.Â If youâre a buyer, thatâs just what you have to deal with in this market. If you donât want to deal with it, then youâll just have to sit on the sidelines and see how things play out for a while. Keep in mind, though, that many are waiting for a market that wonât materialize, and a lot of buyers are finding value now because interest rates have never been lower.Â What can you do to set yourself up to win? Fall in love with the numbers before you fall in love with the house. If you donât understand what kind of loan youâre getting, your down payment, where the money is coming from, etc., thereâs a lot of doubt in your situation. If you donât know where you want to live, what kind of home you want, or what type of life you want, that doubt will make you a âno.â Youâll always be a ânoâ because in your head there will always be something out there that might be better.Â The best advice I can give to any buyer looking to win in this market is to understand why youâre buying, where you want to live, and then zero-in on that area. After that, talk to a lender and figure out what type of situation youâre getting yourself into financially. If youâre not on your game in this market, youâll lose. Iâm seeing a lot of people lose, and itâs costing them a lot of money.Â Weâre here to help you get the property you want at the price you want. If you take our advice, we guarantee youâll win in this market.

        "title": "Which Pricing Strategy Is Right for Your Home?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs a closer look at how you should approach pricing your home for sale.As Iâve touched on in previous videos, three specific factors translate into selling a property for the highest price and best terms:Â 1. Price the home right. Â 2. Make the home look as good as possible with the resources available to you.Â 3. Leverage online and offline marketing to get the word out about it.Â Letâs take a closer look at the first of those factors; though we know the price you set for your home isnât everything, itâs certainly darn close. Whether you have a newly remodeled home or a complete fixer-upper, it always comes down to price, right? If youâve priced your home according to its condition and that number is in line with what buyers in your area are willing to pay, then youâre on the right track. Unfortunately, too many sellers in our market are overly optimistic about their advantage and are therefore overpricing their homes.Â Even in a persistent sellerâs market like ours, you must price your home appropriately, if not even a tad aggressively. Doing so will help you expose your home to the largest number of people, generate a high volume of showings, attract strong offers, and ultimately lead to a fantastic sale price (assuming your agent did everything they were supposed to do). Several pricing strategies can be implemented, but ultimately, your approach should be dependent on the type of home you have. For example, if yours is a unique property thatâs in an area where comparable sales data is scarce, perhaps you should go ahead and price high just to see what the market will bring.However, many of the homes we sell in Orange County tend to have a lot of model matches that give us a good indication of what that home is worth. Oftentimes, homes will sell for a range; some homes have been upgraded while others boast better locations, and others still may require a bit of work. Depending on different factors like upgrades, showability, and (most importantly) list price, any specific home in a given area could sell for somewhere between $900,000 and $1 million.Â So, if homes in a specific area are selling for a range like that, then fair market value would be roughly in the middle. Slightly aggressive would be somewhere under $900,000, whereas aggressive would be above $1 million. There are pros and cons to each strategy. If you price high, you just might get lucky and fetch your price, but know that itâs not likely.Â âYou could lose anywhere from 2% to 4% on your potential sale price due to the wrong pricing strategy.âTodayâs buyers are savvier than those of yesteryear, with boatloads of information and user-friendly real estate tech at their disposal. Weâre just not seeing many buyers significantly overpaying for properties in our current market.Â The most likely scenario if you price high: You sit on the market, have a few showings, lower your price a little, have some more showings, lower your price once again, and then toil away in this fashion until you finally decide to just sell to someone out of desperation. I see this happen all the time. You could lose anywhere from 2% to 4% on your potential sale price due to the wrong pricing strategy.Â The second approach you could take is to price your home within market value and show buyers that youâre motivated by cleaning it up and making it look stellar. In that scenario, you attract multiple offers and sell for a great price.Â Hereâs the third and most successful strategy weâve been seeing in our market lately: pricing the home slightly aggressively. We know demand is high, rates are low, and everybody on the planet wants a great deal. We also know itâs possible to price your home too lowâtoo many offers pour in, and deciding which one of out 30 has a legitimate chance of closing at the best terms quickly becomes a major stressor for sellers. Pricing slightly aggressively, therefore, is the sweet spot where youâll be able to maximize exposure.Â Thereâs no one-size-fits-all pricing strategy, but the bottom line is that your list price has to be in line with the expectations of buyers in your market if you want to create the reaction you want.

        "title": "Which 3 Rules Should 2021 Buyers Follow?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The home-buying woes continue; hereâs how to rise to the challenge.Itâs the new year, and so far, weâre experiencing most of what weâve been experiencing for the last eight months of 2020: low inventory, super-low interest rates, and very high buyer demand. Iâm hoping weâll see a steady increase over time so buyers can have some relief from this relentless market, but for now, our shared reality is that of an aggressive, highly competitive market. If youâre looking for a new home at the moment or soon will be, you need to have a clear and decisive strategy in place. Here are three simple tips for how to win as a buyer in this 2021 sellerâs market:Â 1. Fall in love with the numbers before you fall in love with a property. You need to talk to a lender and make sure you understand every component of your financing. Sadly, 86% of people skip this step, but itâs essential to avoid headaches later on in the process. Are you paying with cash? Are you financing your home purchase with a loan? Do you have the down payment ready, and if not, are you anticipating that those funds will be gifted to you by family? Do you know what your closing costs will be? Whatâs the maximum monthly payment that you could stomach? Do you know the difference between your âcomfort zoneâ budget and your âstretchâ budget? These are the questions that will need to be answered before you start looking for properties in earnest.Â âYou need to talk to a lender and make sure you understand every component of your financing.â2. Get realistic, and focus on what you want. Right now, most properties are selling for above asking price if the home looks great and the price is right. Knowing this, you may want to set your expectations a little lower. In the past, when buyers had more inventory and more time to find a property, Iâd help clients look at houses that were just above their target price range because the market allowed more room for negotiation. While deals still exist in todayâs market, theyâre few and far between. So, if you qualify for a $1 million mortgage, it may be in your best interest to cap your search at $950,000âwith biddings wars as prevalent as they are, a property listed at that price could easily sell for $990,000 or $1 million.Â 3. Submit fast and strong. If youâre a smart buyer whoâs done all their homework up front and know exactly how much you can afford, then be ready to pull the trigger. In this market, you need to act to winâdonât try to play games with the seller. If you want to learn more about what it means to submit a strong offer right out of the gate, then check out any one of the dozens of videos Iâve churned out on that exact topic over the past eight months.Â I hope you found value in todayâs message.

Statistics show that homeowners often hire the first agent they talk to, but that person may not always be the best for the job. There are over 20,000 agents in Orange County, and last year, only 400 of those agents sold 10 homes or more. Not everybody has the experience that a seller needs to get the best price, and some sellers are finding that out the hard way.Once your home falls off the market, you may find that youâre being contacted by many agents who are looking for ways to generate new business. Expired listings are an easy way to have a conversation with a motivated seller that may lead to a potential listing.âStatistics show that homeowners often hire the first agent they talk to, but that person may not always be the best for the job.âSo, once your home fails to sell, whatâs the next step? Here are three things you can do to set yourself up for success as you field all those incoming calls from agents:1. Focus on the agents who make an impression. Around 90% of the agents who call you on day one will never call you again. So if you donât want to sell, donât worry; the calls will stop. But if you are committed to selling, think about which agents are leaving an impression on you and ask them questions to ensure they know what theyâre talking about.2. Ask the agent how many houses they sold in the last 12 months. That will help you determine if the agent youâre speaking to has the experience necessary to sell your home.3. Ask the agent what separates them from the others who are calling you. Most great agents will immediately be able to list two or three things that separate them from their competition.Â If youâve found yourself in the situation where you tried to sell your home and still need to, reach out to me and my team. Iâd love the opportunity to talk with you about how we can help.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Buyers donât want to pay more than market valueâbut what is market value?Many buyers in the market have been saying that they donât want to pay above market value for a home. But hereâs the thing: Market value is not a number. Market value is a price that a buyer is willing to pay based on demand. So understand that thereâs no specific price set when it comes to market value.Now, you will want to look back at the neighborhoodâs history to see what prices homes have sold for, what condition they were in, what time of year it was, and what demand was like at the time. Those are all factors that are considered when a homeâs market value is decided.Buyers who tell me they donât want to pay over market value are often the buyers who may end up losing out on the home. Hereâs an example to help me explain:A few years ago, my parents were looking for a condo in my neighborhood. For them, being close to me was the most important factor in their purchase. There was a home that was listed for $620,000, and at the time, the market value was probably between $615,000 and $625,000. It was a strong market, the home was priced right, and it looked great.Â âOnce your home closes escrow, the next home will be listed for slightly more and probably sell for more.âThe listing agent for the condo said they had offers of up to $625,000 and that they counteroffered everyone. Since this neighborhood was so important to my parents, my mom said to counteroffer them at $640,000. My dad asked me if that was too much. I told him that thereâs no such thing as too muchâthey would be paying more than what recent homes have sold for, but if it made sense for them to pay that much and it was in their price range, $640,000 would be a great number.My mom looked at us both and said, âI donât want to play any games; offer them $642,000.â We submitted that offer, which was accepted, and theyâve been living in that property for two years now. They absolutely love it.The great news is that the minute the transaction closed and became official, that price became the market value. Now that property is one that appraisers will look at to determine what homebuyers are willing to pay in a specific area.With inventory and interest rates so low and demand so high, weâre seeing homes sell for more than what appraisers can justify, so many buyers feel like theyâre overpaying for properties. In some cases, they may technically be, but remember that as long as the monthly payment is within your comfort zone and youâre getting a fixed rate on your loan, then it doesnât matter if you spent an extra $5,000 or $10,000. At the end of the day, once your home closes escrow, the next one will be listed for slightly more and probably sell for more, thus continuing the trend.If you want to dive deeper into the subject of market value or have any questions, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to talk to you.",

        "content": "The key to selling your home for the most money lies in your marketing plan.Whether you plan to put your home on the market in the next month or the next couple of years, there are three things that you need to focus on as a seller when youâre working with an agent to list your home for sale. Fortunately for you, it all comes down to marketing. Iâve broken our marketing strategy into three parts:1. Price. Think about a time when a product you were waiting to buy suddenly dropped in price. What did that make you want to do? Chances are that it made you want to go out there and get it right away. When it comes to listing your home, my team uses several different pricing strategies depending on the client, the market, and what our goals are. That said, how you price a property directly affects the number of buyers who will see your home.2. Home preparation. That doesnât necessarily mean home upgrades, although sometimes it may. Most of the time, the goal is to take the property and use the resources and time available to us to make it look as good as possible when it goes live on the market. Sometimes that involves cleaning the carpets, interior/exterior paint touch-ups, deep cleaning, and/or making minor repairs.3. Traditional real estate marketing. Word of your homeâs availability will be sent to everyone via the MLS, which is the primary database that all agents use. Through the MLS, your listing will also be sent to other, third-party consumer websites such as Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, Trulia, Homes.com, and so many other sites.Â âYou have to work with an agent who understands how to market using price, preparation, and all the resources available.âBeyond those, there are other online and offline strategies available (too many to list here), but the one unifying fact behind them all is that selling is all about psychology. The higher the emotional connection a buyer has with a property that youâre selling, the more theyâll be willing to pay.We in the Robert Mack Group specialize in telling a story. Buyers love them. It doesnât matter what theyâre buyingâif thereâs a story behind it, it means thereâs more value behind it. We tell stories using tactics like print advertising, and mail.If you want the best price for your home, you have to work with an agent who understands how to market using price, preparation, and all the resources available to us to help get the word out.If you or someone you know is thinking about listing a home, reach out to the Robert Mack Group. I want to tell you about what we can do to set you up for success.",

        "title": "Removing the Fluff: Buying &amp; Selling During the Holidays",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The fluff will be removed from the market; what does that mean for you?A lot of people are saying that because the holidays are right around the corner, theyâre not sure if now is the right time to buy or sell or if theyâd be better off waiting. Now, before I share my response, remember that real estate doesnât have a one-size-fits-all approach, so my advice today may or may not apply to your specific situation. That said, you can always reach out to me if youâd like to discuss it in more detail.Interest rates are currently low, and though we do anticipate an increase in 2021, theyâre holding steady for now. Beyond that, there are two key issues at play when it comes to buying and selling during the holidays: inventory and demand.Â If youâve been following my blog, youâll know that inventory has been super low, which has raised demand. Itâs slim pickings out there for buyers, meaning that theyâre paying premium prices for properties. That, in turn, means sellers are selling their homes for record prices.However, 80% of our sellers are also buyers, and like all buyers, theyâre having trouble finding properties. Will it get worse? It likely will for the next few weeks until the new year, when inventory rises again.âWe are in a sweet spot right now where itâs a great time for both buyers and sellers to act.âHowever, a whole other series of issues come when inventory begins to rise. As I discussed in previous posts, 30% of our current inventory is stale inventory, meaning that itâs either an unmotivated seller who, in their attempt to test out the market, has overpriced their home, or itâs a property that needs a lot of work. As the holiday season approaches, that 30% of homeowners whose homes have been sitting on the market for too long may pull their homes from the market and deal with it next year. Thatâs why todayâs post is titled âRemoving the Fluff.â Although inventory is falling, the inventory of sellable homes is actually going to stay right where it is.Demand is also going to fall, just like the unmotivated sellers. The buyers who donât have a real need to purchase right now are also going to leave the market in favor of celebrating the holidays.That means sellers have a great opportunity if they list their homes now. Youâll have less competition from other sellers, and the motivated buyers will still be in the market to search for a home. Demand for individual homes is still very, very high, and we expect that to continue through the new year. Youâre sure to get a very good price in our current market.Keep in mind, though, that not every agent is the same. A great agent can squeeze in an extra 2% to 5% more out of your home than the average agent. Even though the market is hot, donât list your home with just anyone. Make sure you work with a professional.For buyers, itâs a great time to consider a purchase. Yes, youâre going to pay a premium for the available properties, but the beauty of it is that you have less competition from other buyers, and interest rates are low. Donât forget that the people who are still in the market are playing to win, so competition will still be fierce.All in all, we are in a sweet spot right now where itâs a great time for both buyers and sellers to act.If youâd like to have a more in-depth conversation about your position in the market or you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. Iâd love to be your resource.",

        "title": "How Can Buyers Make Their Offer Stand Out?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Here are five ways to make your offer stand out.If youâre a buyer and ready to start shopping for homes, you should know that itâs brutal out there. There isnât a lot of inventory, which has made it hard for a lot of buyers to find the right home. Historically low interest rates are only adding fuel to the fireâbuyers want to get their offer accepted now even though they know theyâre paying a premium because they also know that these rates equate to long-term savings.Â Let me tell you a quick story. Back in 1982, the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls were introduced to the world and started selling faster than stores could restock their shelves with them. The savvy buyers (i.e., those who knew when the deliveries of these dolls were being made) were able to get in line at stores and buy a doll for just $30. The unprepared buyers had to offer as much as $100 to the savvy buyers for a single doll because their kids wanted them so badlyâthree times as much as the retail value.Â Thatâs what weâre seeing right now. Only the most prepared, aggressive buyers are winning. If youâre not willing to play ball, youâre going to lose. With that in mind, there are five ways you can make your offer stand out among the competition. Price is what will get sellersâ attention, but these tips will help you stand out from other buyers:1. Remove the appraisal contingency. Right now, weâre dealing with appraisal issues. Appraisers value properties based on past sales, and homes are sold based on what a buyer feels itâs worth and its future value. Weâre finding that thereâs a gap between what banks think homes are worth and what buyers think theyâre worth. If you have the cash reserves, consider removing the appraisal contingency from your offer and offer to pay the difference between the appraised value and the agreed-upon price (within reason). For example, you can offer to pay up to $20,000 to cover any appraisal gap. That will give the seller peace of mind.Â 2. Call the listing agent to ensure you understand the sellerâs situation. Do they want a long or short escrow period? What else is important to them? Write your offer based on their needs, because most sellers are choosing offers based on what makes sense to them, even if those offers donât include the highest price.Â 3. Tighten your inspection timelines. As a buyer, youâll have time to do inspections, review disclosures and HOA documents, have the appraisal, etc. All of these inspections come with contingency timelines that are usually between 17 and 21 days. Consider doing your inspections in, say, 10 days, or reviewing the appraisal in 12 days. Anything you can do to add peace of mind to the seller and show them youâre motivated will make you look stronger.Â âOnly the most prepared, aggressive buyers are winning.â4. Remove certain seller closing costs. For example, a lot of buyers ask sellers to pay for a home warranty worth $550. If you can pay that yourself, it will net the seller more money. Or instead of the seller paying for and scheduling the termite inspection, you can offer to do it. Whatever the case may be, many buyers are offering to pay the sellersâ customary closing costs to add value to their net without improving the purchase price, so you should do the same.Â 5. Work with a good agent. If Iâm a seller and get multiple offers, I look for the best price and terms, the most motivated buyer, and one who will stay in escrow even when things get tough. Additionally, Iâm looking to work with a great agent, and I know the buyerâs agent is looking for the same thing. This means you should work with an agent who knows how to make an offer that sellers will fall in love with.Â If youâd like to know more about how to get your offer accepted or have any other real estate questions, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Hereâs what kind of seller you need to be to sell for top dollar.What kind of seller are you? Iâve been selling real estate for 15 years, and in that time, Iâve dissected many types of clients.Â Iâve found that there are three types of sellers:  The seller who wants to do nothing to their home except list it.Â   The seller who wants to do everything to their home before listing it.  The seller whoâs willing to keep an open mind and make minor repairs and modifications to their home so it shows as a high-quality product and maximizes their ROI.If you havenât figured it out by now, Iâm a big fan of the last type. In other words, Iâm a big fan of considering minor repairs and design modifications to make your home look and feel more expensive than it is and make buyers comfortable about submitting their highest offer. As a seller, itâs important to understand that fewer than 5% of all homes are ready to sell right away. Most people have to do something to make their homes show better.Â âFigure out where you stand as a seller.âIn my world, buyers buy based on perceived value. Theyâll make an offer based on emotion, then justify it based on logic. Oftentimes, with just a small investment, you can make your home look $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, or even $100,000 more expensive. By âsmall investment,â I mean typically as little as $5,000 to $10,000.Â As Iâve said many times before: Real estate is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Sellers who arenât willing to make upgrades or enhancements before selling are potentially leaving money on the table. Similarly, sellers who want to upgrade everything are also potentially leaving money on the table.Â Sellers who keep an open mind and consider making small repairs, though, are the ones who win. This could mean repainting the interior, steam cleaning the carpets, getting the home professionally staged, etc. Statistically, staged homes sell for 5% to 6% more and 75% quicker than unstaged homes.Â So, figure out where you stand as a seller. Do you want to make a ton of upgrades, no upgrades at all, or work with a real estate expert who knows exactly what buyers are looking for so you can maximize your ROI?

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs how to determine the best time for you to buy a home.When is the best time to buy a home?Before I answer that question, Iâll address another question I get asked frequently: Howâs the market? That is a difficult question to answer because everyone is different. If you ask an agent how the market is and they tell you itâs hot, thatâs not a great answer. Some people want to buy, and within that category alone, there are people who want to buy primary residences, second homes, and investment properties. Others want to sell or just rent. On top of that, different price ranges require different answers. There are so many criteria to consider that we canât always say definitively whether itâs a good time to buy or sell.Â However, there are clearly times in the market where it makes sense to buyâespecially if youâre a buyer who can afford to buy a property and have a compelling reason to buy. So when people ask me about the best time to buy, itâs very rarely related to the market. Instead, itâs usually related to their personal situation. Thatâs why my answer boils down to two factors: 1) when you can afford to buy, and 2) when you have the desire to buy.Â âIf you are interested in buying and can afford to do so, though, itâs a great time to make your move.âI should also stress that not everyone is a potential buyer. Sometimes people contact me because someone else told them to buy, but Iâm not a big fan of people buying properties if they donât feel the need to do so on their own. If you are interested in buying and can afford to do so, though, itâs a great time to make your move.Â Right now, affordability is as high as itâs ever been. I know it sounds counterintuitive, but interest rates control everything. As a mentor of mine once said, âWhen you buy a property, price is a one-time thing, but your interest rate is what you have to see every single month.â Nowadays, people are getting fixed mortgages, so if youâre approved for a loan, you can feel comfortable knowing your monthly payment will be the same for the life of your loan. If youâre renting, on the other hand, you never know what your landlord will do. Will they raise your rent or not?If youâre not sure you can afford to buy a property, give me a call and Iâd be happy to refer you to a great local lender who can help you understand your financial capabilities.

We call these âcanceledâ or âexpiredâ listings (and, sometimes, âwithdrawnâ). There are rules we have to follow when handling these types of listings.Â So if youâve failed to sell your home in the past and are now receiving a ton of calls from different agents, you may be wondering: âWhere the heck were these people when my home was for sale?ââ35% of all homes that come off the market are relisted within 60 days.âWhen a home doesnât sell and comes off the market, it becomes public record. In my experience, I know that homes come off the market for a variety of reasons. The problem couldâve been the agent, the home itself, personal issues with the seller, etc. You name it, Iâve heard it. I also know that 35% of all homes that come off the market are relisted within 60 days. Basically, youâre getting all these phone calls because agents are looking for more business.Â Iâll go out on a limb here and say that roughly nine out of every 10 agents donât have the experience to help you rebrand and reposition your property so that it sells at a record price. My team and I absolutely understand why homes donât sell, and we call canceled listings daily. We know that there are would-be sellers out there who are confused and frustrated because they have all these agents calling them, sending them things in the mail, and knocking on their door. It can all be quite overwhelmingâespecially during the first week.Â The best advice I can give you to deal with this situation is to listen to what these agents have to say. If you still need to sell, make a list of the agents you feel have the necessary experience to get the job done. I recommend interviewing anywhere from three to five agents to find the best one. Remember, not all agents are the same. We all have different experience levels, marketing strategies, team structures, networks, and processes we follow.Â If youâre thinking of putting your home back on the market or need to sell but donât know where to start, give me a call.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Hereâs how sellers can avoid appraisal issues when listing their property.How can you avoid appraisal issues as a seller?Before answering that question, letâs talk for a moment about value. Many of my teamâs buyer clients ask us what their options are if they submit an offer on a home but the appraisal doesnât match that value. The thing is, value is a relative term. In other words, a home is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it.Â When a buyer gets a loan to buy a home, they must get an appraisal, but this appraisal isnât designed to protect the consumerâitâs designed to protect the lender. Appraisals exist because, if a lender allows a buyer to borrow money, they need to ensure that theyâll be able to recover their funds if the buyer canât pay back their loan and they have to foreclose on the home and sell it.Â Appraisers will do their best to justify the price a buyer offers for a home, but thereâs a bit of a disconnect with the process because they justify value based on past sales. These past sales can be anywhere from one to six months old, and the market is changing rapidly. When I work with a seller, my job is to justify the highest possible price based on future values. What will a homebuyer pay for this property? What do we have to do to get them to see the value of it?Â A seller accepting an offer for a price the appraiser canât justify is a common occurrence in our low-inventory, high-demand market where homes are selling for record prices. Homes are selling at never-before-seen prices, and itâs hard for a conservative lender to justify this.Â âIf a buyer wants to pay more for a home than what the appraiser thinks itâs worth, thatâs on them.âSo, to avoid future appraisal issues, the solution is simple. If you have an offer with a price you donât think can be justified by an appraisal, do your due diligence and make sure the buyer has enough funds to cover the gap. Again, a home is only worth what a buyer is willing to pay for it. If a buyer wants to pay more for a home than what the appraiser thinks itâs worth, thatâs on them.Â In this situation, weâll remove the appraisal contingency, which states that if the home appraises for less than what the buyer agrees to pay for it, they have to pay the difference in cash. The buyer will have to increase their down payment to cover that gap because the lender will only lend you a certain amount of the appraised value for your loan.Â Thereâs a lot more that goes into this, but we at the Robert Mack Group have spent the last seven years dissecting the home-selling experience. Weâve identified the pain points such as this and do everything we can to get in front of this issue to reduce friction during the transaction. Make sure you work with an agent who understands this because the last thing you want is the buyer renegotiating the price of the property because their appraisal came in low.Â Keep in mind that appraisers are human beings. If you were to hire three or four of them to appraise the same home, it wouldnât be unusual if they all came back with a different value.Â If you want your home sale to be a smooth transaction, please give me a call. If youâre curious about your homeâs value or have any other real estate questions, feel free to reach out to me as well. Iâd love to help. Until then, happy selling!",

        "title": "Why Are Homes So Affordable Right Now?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why are homes more affordable now than ever before? Letâs discuss this.One of my old mentors told me a long time ago that prices are a one-time thing; your monthly payments and your interest rates are what you have to see every month.If you were to buy a $1-million property today with a 3.25% interest rate and 20% down, your monthly payment would be $3,482. If those rates went up to 4.25%, your monthly payment would be $3,936âthatâs a $500-difference for just a 1% increase!Â If youâre thinking about waiting until prices fall to make a purchase, here areÂ a few questions to consider to decide whether it makes sense to buy now or wait:1. How much will prices fall when they do? Based on the inventory and demand in our market, I donât see prices falling more than 10%. I think weâll see prices stabilize in the future and maybe drop by 3% to 5% depending on the area. However, I do see interest rates rising by 1% as the world and economy get stronger.âI havenât seen a better time to sell a property than right now.â2. When is that price fall going to happen? Do you think it will happen in six months? 12 months? 18 months? Itâs hard to be sure. And for that matterâ¦3. How high will prices be? If prices from todayâs market rise 15% over the next 18 months and then begin to fall, theyâre going to have to fall another 15% to get to a point where buyers feel like theyâre getting the deal theyâve been waiting for.4. How high will the interest rates be when the prices fall? Interest rates are much more likely to rise than prices are to fall, which is why I believe youâll get a better deal buying a home now than you will in 12 to 24 months when the prices fall. In my opinion, many buyers are going to be paying more per month for a home they bought for less.Â For sellers in the market, know that I havenât seen a better time to sell a property than right now. If youâre waiting to liquidate your assets to take that money and do something else with it, you probably still have more time. The market is likely still going to appreciate, though thereâs no guaranteeâthe election is coming up, unemployment is still high, and the pandemic is still active.Â We donât know for sure what the future is going to look like, but if you list your home now, youâll almost certainly get a great price for it if you work with the right agent, price your home correctly, and improve its condition. You might get a little more for it in six months, but whether or not you should wait and see depends on your bigger-picture plans.For those who are selling their homes in order to buy a new one, right now is the time to make it happen. Those low interest rates work in your favor, too, and they might not be around forever.If you have any questions about buying or selling in our market, please reach out to us.

        "title": "Why Are Buyers Paying Too Much?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Buyers are currently paying too much for homes. Hereâs how to avoid that.These days, most buyers are paying too much for the homes theyâre buying. Iâm not talking just about the price of the property; Iâm also talking about their experience from the day they begin looking until their offer is accepted. Iâve been doing a ton of research on this, most of it through our clients, and what Iâve found is that the standard buyer in our current market is missing out on an average of three properties before they get an offer accepted. This then results in buyers paying too much money for homes. More is less in a market thatâs appreciating as aggressively as the one weâre in right now.Â A real-life example: I had a client that was pre-approved for $750,000. She was looking in a particular area she liked, and we found an excellent house that was listed for $740,000. At first, she was tentative and wanted to negotiate. Many buyers want to do this; theyâll offer $730,000 to see what happens.Â Well, what happens is we wonât even receive a counteroffer. In this case, the property sold for $742,000. Had my client come in a bit higher on her offer, she still would have gotten the home for within her price range.Â âThe standard buyer in our current market is missing out on an average of three properties before they get an offer accepted.âThen, the next house in the area that was comparable was listed for $745,000. They understood that they could get a little more for their property based on what the previous one sold for. I told her to offer $747,000 and show the seller we mean business before she missed out on another home. However, she decided to offer $740,000, and again, we didnât get a counteroffer.Â The third house that was comparable was listed for $755,000, and she doesnât qualify for it. We submitted an offer of $750,000, and it wasnât accepted. Now sheâs looking in another area because she can no longer afford the appreciating home prices in her first-choice neighborhood. Unfortunately, sheâs now settling for an area that isnât her top choice because she didnât offer the best price in the beginning. Also, the person that paid $755,000 could have gotten the property earlier for $742,000 but overpaid because they werenât as aggressive from the get-go.Â If youâre a buyer looking for a home, understand what you qualify for and know that you may have to go a bit higher to get the house you want. However, the sooner you get that property, the betterâbecause each home will get more expensive, and that trend will continue. Then youâll either have to settle or pay more than you wanted.If you want to discuss buying a property and learn how my team and I support our clients and get them the best deal possible, send me an email or give me a call.

        "category": "",
        "content": "These are the two main things that will help you sell for top dollar.Today I want to keep it very simple. There are two things you should focus on if youâre considering selling your home. Houses that look great and are priced accurately are the ones that sell for top dollar in the shortest time. If youâre working with me or my team, we take this off your plate and do it for you. However, if youâre working with another team or agent, these are the two things to keep in mind:1. How can I put out the best product? This doesnât necessarily mean making upgradesâIâm not a fan of that. Unless youâre going to upgrade the entire home, youâre virtually wasting your time because no one likes a Frankenstein house. I prefer cleaning up the property, making minor repairs, removing eyesores, steam-cleaning carpets, repainting rooms, and staging. These things will make the property look so appealing to the buyer that they will be instantly connected emotionally and imagine themselves living there.Â âHouses that look great and are priced accurately are the ones that sell for top dollar.â2. How can I price it to maximize exposure? Let all the buyers out there know your home is not only available, but also that youâre motivated to sell it. If you do this right, it will result in multiple offers. Right now, weâre seeing many homeowners price their houses very high. Theyâre thinking that because inventory and interest rates are low, people will pay a premium. This isnât the case.Â Buyers want to buy, but theyâre very savvy and have a ton of information at their fingertips. I recommend pricing your property right around the same price that other homes have been selling for in the area. For example, if your house is worth $1 million and homes in your neighborhood are selling for $975,000 to $1 million, price yours at $998,000. Youâll be within the correct price range and get many offers.Â If you know anyone who may benefit from this message, send it to them.

        "content": "In this intense sellerâs market, buyers need to know a few things.If youâre a buyer whoâs actively looking or getting ready to start looking for a home, it can be a little frustrating right now. Last year at this time, Orange County had over 7,500 properties available for sale, and it was considered a low inventory market. Flash forward to today, and weâre hovering under 5,000 properties for sale.Â You may think this sounds like a ton of homes, but when you dissect that inventory per city, house type, number of bedrooms, and price range, weâre finding there are really only about a dozen houses for what each buyer is looking for. If youâre a buyer and only have 12 properties to look at, that may not be enough to find the right one for you and your family. These days weâre seeing many buyers do the âready, aim, waitâ approach. This means theyâve spoken to a lender and have been pre-approved, but theyâre waiting on the sidelines because they havenât found a home they love yet.Â With all of these things at play, a ton of buyers feel as if theyâve missed the bus. Had they bought in the last few years they would have a lot more equity, and theyâve been seeing prices steadily increase, so now theyâre waiting until the market turns before they buy. While thatâs something to consider, keep this in mind: Most economists and top real estate agents believe prices will continue to rise for at least 18 to 24 months.Â You can certainly wait for lower prices, but how high are they going to increase before dropping again? How far will they fall once they do begin to decrease? Thereâs a chance that home prices may increase another 10% to 15%, then only fall 5% to 7%. Hereâs the bottom line: No one has a crystal ball and knows exactly whatâs going to happen.Â âMost economists and top real estate agents believe prices will continue to rise for at least 18 to 24 months.âSo hereâs the best advice I can give to any buyer:1. Be prepared. Speak to a lender, understand what you can afford, and know the kind of loan youâll be applying for.2. Work with an agent. Know the type of house youâre looking for.3. Be flexible.Â 4. Be patient.Â These four things together will put you in a position to find the right property. We could all sit back and wait for deals, or we can remember that life goes on, and we canât put our lives on hold indefinitely. With interest rates where they are right now, itâs an excellent opportunity to get out there. It may not be the best time for everyone to buy, but itâs a fantastic time to build equity and set yourself up for future wealth.Â If you have any questions about buying a home or real estate in general, reach out to my us via phone or email.

It may not be the right time for you personally to sell, for various reasons.Â Nevertheless, if youâve been considering or need to sell, todayâs housing market presents an incredible opportunity. Here are the top four reasons that right now is the best time to sell:1. Inventory is exceptionally low. To put this into perspective, last year at this time Orange County as a whole had 7,500 houses available for sale, and even then we were still in a low inventory season. Today, Orange County has fewer than 5,000 houses available for sale. Inventory is about 30% to 35% lower compared to this time in 2019. If you thought it was slim pickings then, now weâre in a whole other ballgame.Â 2. Interest rates are historically low. When we look at the strongest sellerâs markets from the past 20 years, 2001 to 2005 was the best period, where interest rates were hovering around 5% to 6%. Today, rates are in the high twos and low threes. Even though that earlier market was appreciating, buyers are more excited to buy now.Â 3. Buyer demand and confidence are through the roof. Buyers feel good about purchasing properties right now; they feel itâs a great life decision and investment.Â 4. Thereâs no end in sight. Many of my current clients are asking if prices are going to fall, but everything we see right now indicates this will continue for a while. Someday prices will decrease; the real estate market is cyclical. However, we donât expect prices to drop for another 18 to 24 months, maybe even longer.Â âBuyers feel good about purchasing properties right now.âIf youâre considering selling, you have very little competition, buyers want to buy, and interest rates are so low itâs almost free to borrow money. All this is a recipe for success.Â If youâre thinking about selling, reach out, and let us know how we can help. The real estate agent you hire matters. Just because itâs a strong sellerâs market doesnât mean you donât need a professionalâs help. Strategy is still required for you to sell in the right amount of time for top dollar.If youâre interested in selling your home or want to know a bit more about how the process works, reach out to me or my team. We would love to help you. Also, if you ever have anything you want me to cover in a future video, please let me know.Â ",

We are currently locking in our clients with rates between 3% and 3.5% for 30-year fixed mortgages and under 3% for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages.Iâm not saying that just because rates are so low you need to make a move, but itâs important to think about how you can leverage these rates to increase the quality of your life. It doesnât always make sense to buy or refinance, but it would be careless to not consider how you could leverage rates this low.âIf it was easy, everyone would be doing it.âThere are a few different options. You might live in a home that you already love and have no intentions of moving from, but you can still talk to a lender about what a refinance could save you in the long term. If you could save a few hundred dollars per month, you want to strike while the iron is hot.Another option you have is leveraging these low rates to buy your first homeâor a better home. People move for all different kinds of reasons, and if youâre looking to buy something that better fits your needs, see if itâs going to work out for you. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Sometimes, short-term pain will give you long term pleasure.

        "content": "If your home has failed to sell in the past and you blamed the market, I have news for you: The real culprit is your motivation and your strategy.If youâre a current home seller who is having a hard time selling, or a homeowner who has failed to sell in the past, itâs not the marketâitâs your strategy. Let me explain:I talk to a lot of homeowners who have tried to sell in the past unsuccessfully and their No. 1 scapegoat is the market. Does the market play a massive role in what you sell your home for? Absolutely. Can you sell a home for a lot more when the marketâs hot? Yes. However, there is one thing I want you to think about.When I meet with a client, the first thing I focus on is their motivation. What I have found is that the homeowners who donât really have to sell, but would like to sell, know they just wonât sell unless they get the price they want. When I hear that, I hear an unmotivated seller. âNot motivatedâ doesnât mean that theyâre not willing to sell, but it does mean that theyâre not willing to sell for a price that makes sense to buyers. If the situation isnât perfect, they arenât willing to sacrifice whatâs necessary to get the price they want.âUnmotivated buyers are just waiting for the perfect situation that may never come.âWhen I meet a client who is motivated for one reason or another, the next question they have is, âWhat can you sell our home for now?â and âWhat can we do to squeeze a little bit more money out now?âThink about it like this. If you must sell your stocks and the next day the price goes up, you canât get mad. When the prices are high and you cash out, youâre happy, but the stock is going to sell for what the going rate is today. The same thing happens with real estate. If you arenât going to put your strategy together based on the current market, youâre going to lose.We canât create miracles and get buyers to pay 10% to 15% more than itâs worth. If you are thinking about getting your home back on the market, here are a few questions you should ask yourself and your agent:  How was my home presented the last time it was on the market?  How did the photos look online?  Did we price the home according to what homes in the area are selling for?  Are we competitive based on what else is out there?  What was the agentâs feedback?  What was the buyerâs feedback?I call this a listing experience audit, and everytime I meet with a seller who failed to sell in the past, this is what we start with. Once we answer these questions, we can find solutions to your future home sale.If you have any questions for me, donât hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon. Until then, Happy selling!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Every home seller wants to maximize their final sale price. Hereâs our best strategy for doing so.Traditionally, home sellers meet with an agent, look at comparable sales, look at your current competition, consider the aspects of the market in your area, consider interest rates, then generally come up with a price that you think your home is worth.We already know that a home is worth whatever a buyer is willing to pay for it. If you think your home is worth $1 million, but you canât get anyone to pay $1 million, then itâs not worth $1 million in the end. You have to come up with a price that your home will sell for based on what a buyer thinks itâs worth.If youâve been to an auction before, you know that sometimes peoplesâ competitive spirit can take over. When people get competitive, they often lose sight of whatâs important. Many people go to auctions looking for a great deal, but end up leaving paying a premium for something that they really wanted because of the transparent bidding. When thereâs someone in this room willing to pay more than you, you might want to end up paying more than they are willing to.âBuyers might pay a bit more than they have to in a hot market like this.âIn this kind of market, we love to give buyers the ability to determine what they feel is market value. We do this by pricing the home a little aggressively and slightly below market value. Once that home gets listed, everyone is going to see the price, and thatâs going to get them through the door. Youâre dangling a carrot and showing buyers that they could be missing out on a huge deal. Once you attract the masses, youâll start to receive offers, and the bidding wars will commence.Many times, we have been able to sell homes for more than we thought they were worth on paper through this strategy. Buyers are willing to pay a little bit more than they have to in a hot market like this when thereâs a lot of competition.If you want to sell your home for the absolute best price, this is the strategy we recommend. If you have any questions for me about our home-selling strategies, or anything else related to real estate, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Buying a home in this market can be tough, but if youâre willing to offer a little bit more upfront, you can see huge benefits in the long-term. Hereâs why.Iâm not sure what it costs you to go out for a night on the town, but for me and my wife, a nice dinner will cost us somewhere between $70 and $80, possibly up to $150 if we have some drinks. At the end of the night, weâre always satisfied with our meal, but weâre also second-guessing ourselves, wondering if we should have just saved that money and used it for something else.Iâm not saying you shouldnât ever go out and have fun, but more often than not, itâs shocking how many clients we have who qualify for a certain price point, find a property thatâs below that point, and end up getting stuck on a number.For example, letâs say a buyer is qualified for $800,000 and we find a perfect home for them for $775,000. In the kind of hot sellerâs market weâre in right now, this home could very well have multiple offers and the price could get pushed up to $785,000. We have seen our clients miss out on this kind of property because they arenât willing to pay the $10,000 to $15,000 over asking price that might be necessary.Â âDonât get stuck on price, focus on the big picture.âWe arenât in the business of pushing people into making decisions that theyâre not comfortable with. However, if you know that you qualify for $800,000 and are comfortable with those payments, itâs almost absurd not to make that offer of $780,000 or $785,000 to get the property that you love. In this current market, prices are going up and theyâll keep going up.What does a night out have to do with it? Well, every $5,000 in your mortgage budget generally translates to $25 to $40 per month on your monthly payment. For an extra $10,000, itâs more like $50 to $80. If youâre willing to pass on the home of your dreams over $50 bucks a month, you may want to reevaluate your strategy. Right now, offering a little bit more than youâd ideally want to in this market ultimately means that youâre getting the home for less because the prices will continue to go up. Donât get stuck on the price right now, focus on the big picture price.Â If you have any questions for me in the meantime, donât hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "In the housing market, everything always takes longer than you think. Hereâs what I mean.Before I get into todayâs housing market update, I want to tell you a quick story:Iâve always struggled with my weight. I used to ask a friend of mine what he was doing to stay in shape. He responded by saying, âDonât overcomplicate itâeat less and workout more.âOur tendency to overcomplicate things can manifest everywhere, even these market updates, so today Iâll keep it as simple as possible:For homebuyers, interest rates are historically low. Buyers with 15-year mortgages are locking in rates in the 2% range, and those with 30-year mortgages are locking in rates in the low to high 3% range, depending on their financial situations. That means now is a great time to borrow money and to buy a home.The downside for buyers in the market is that inventory is also historically low, meaning there just arenât as many homes available on the market as there are buyers searching for them. This makes it a bit more challenging to find a great home now than it wouldâve been in recent years. Thatâs just the way the market is; I tell all my buying clients that all we can do is the best we can in the current conditions.âBuyers arenât stupid;  they wonât overpay for a property if they donât see the value in it.âNow, if youâre a seller, the market is on fire. Since thereâs such little supply, demand is super high. If your home shows well, brings in an emotional connection that buyers are looking for, and is priced aggressively, it will fly off the market with multiple offers.We still see homes sitting on the market, however. Buyers arenât stupid; they have all the information they need at their fingertips, so they wonât overpay for a property if they donât see the value in it.Hereâs a tip that will benefit all buyers and sellers: everything always takes longer than you think.This highlights the importance of setting a goal. No matter if youâre a buyer or seller, you need to create a plan and include a 30% buffer in it. For example, if you think itâll take two months to accomplish your goal, shoot for two, but plan for three. This way, your expectations will be met, and youâll have extra time to account for the curveballs life sometimes throws our way.If you have any questions about the housing market, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâm always happy to connect with you.",

        "content": "For those who failed to sell their home the first time around, Iâm highlighting the three most important things to consider before trying again.35% of people who try unsuccessfully to sell their home will relist within a couple of months. Iâm a proponent of auditing your last attempt before giving it another shot: Was there an issue with your pricing strategy? Did your agent fail to drum up enough attention for the home? Did you not plan for a certain trend in the market?Itâs tough to pinpoint what went wrong, but I highly recommend sellers interview other agents for a fresh perspective. Going back to the same agent may not be the best approach.Â âTo generate traffic, you need to off the home at a price thatâs a bit more attractive than what would be considered market value.âHere are the three things that matter most when relisting your property:Â 1. How your home shows. If your $1 million listing has mediocre photography revealing a cluttered inside, how can you expect to give buyers that special sense of excitement? They simply wonât pay top dollar for it. Without a solid home preparation strategy, youâre leaving a lot of money on the table.Â 2. Price. Inventory is low, interest rates are low, and buyers want to buy. A fair-priced home that looks great will fly off the market for top dollar, likely via multiple offers. Though there are plenty of psychological strategies to maximize the amount an interested buyer is willing to pay for your home, you first have to spark interest amongst buyers.To generate traffic, you need to offer the home at a price thatâs a bit more attractive than what would be considered market value. Thatâs the key to spurring multiple offers.Â 3. Working with an agent who knows what theyâre doing. Make sure your agent has a strong marketing campaign that will expose your home citywide, countywide, nationwide, and even globally (never underestimate where buyers are coming from these days). Your agent needs tried-and-true systems in place to move the process along smoothly.Â If you want to have a more in-depth discussion about what my team and I can do to get your home sold for the price you want in our current market, shoot me a message or give me a call.

        "content": "Today Iâm sharing a real-life example of why sellers should never leave the quality of life out of their home-selling equation.Although 90% of the people I work with are not investors, I find that many of them think like investors, asking questions like, âWhenâs the best time to list so that we can get the most amount of money?â or âHow can we position our home on the market to maximize our sale?âOf course, those things are important, but what a lot of homeowners donât do enough of is focus on their quality of life. In other words, what is your quality of life in your current home, and how will that change when you move into a home thatâs better for you?Â Hereâs a real-life example to drive my point home: I met a client last week who lives in a three-level property, and whose parents live in that third level. Mom and dad are older, and their knees donât work so well; theyâre exhausted from having to march up and down two storiesâ worth of stairs every day.Â Despite their parentsâ dissatisfaction, my client was more concerned with timing the market to get top dollar on their home sale. My response to their market questions is simple: How is your quality of life? How is the third-floor bedroom affecting your parents? Is selling for an extra 1% to 2% worth their continued unhappiness?Â âWhat I am stressing is that, when considering giant life decisions, quality of life should be a top factor.âAgain, Iâm not saying that market timing isnât important, nor am I implying that you shouldnât want to sell your home for the most amount of money. What I am stressing is that, when considering giant life decisions, quality of life should be a top factor.Â My goal when I work with a seller is to maximize the home sale and squeeze out every penny of equity, but also make sure that at the forefront of the whole process is a commitment to their quality of life. Â If youâre a potential seller, know this: The 2020 market has begun aggressively. Weâre experiencing activity typically reserved for March and April because inventory is so low. If youâre waiting for those traditional spring months, you may want to consider selling sooner than later to take advantage of these unique market conditions.Â Secondly, sellers, consider your quality of life; in my opinion, itâs worth more than anything else. You could time your home sale around what the marketâs doing, but an equally valid move is to time your home sale around your quality of life. Perhaps youâre just sick of your current living conditions, and itâs enough grief to make you say, âIâm selling right now!âÂ Once you have your âwhyââimproving your quality of lifeâthen you should work with your agent to answer questions like, âWhat can I do right now in this market to maximize my net?âÂ If you have questions about this or any other real estate topic or are considering making a real estate move in 2020, please feel free to reach out to me. Even if you simply want to pick my brain about something, Iâd be happy to talk with you.",

Inventory is about 40% lower than it was at this time last year. Interest rates are almost a full percentage point lower than this time last year. So thereâs a massive amount of demand but simply not enough homes out there to satisfy.Â When a great home does hit the market at a fair price, multiple offers usually drive its price up.Â The home buying process is all about removing the emotion and creating as much certainty as possible. For example, speaking with a lender and knowing what your monthly payment will be creates certainty and gives you more confidence as a buyer.Â âMy clients were comfortable paying a little more to secure a highly sought-after home now, knowing that it would go for more money the next time itâs sold on the market.âTo illustrate my point, hereâs an example: There was a property in Irvine and my clients absolutely loved it. It was one of the only 4-bedroom properties in the entire city, and, since my clients needed four bedrooms, the demand in this equation was very, very high.Â This property was listed for $750,000. After we looked at what other similar homes in the area sold for and did the math, we felt as though $770,000âmaybe $775,000âwould work. Ultimately, we came in super strong and got the offer accepted at $780,000.Â My clients admitted to feeling as though they paid too much for the homeâa sentiment I do understand. However, a couple of weeks later, the exact same home model came onto the MLS at $790,000 and, after receiving tons of offers, went under contract just shy of $800,000.Â This is where the âmore is lessâ mantra comes into play: My clients were comfortable paying a little more to secure a highly sought-after home now, knowing that it would go for more money the next time itâs sold on the market.Â Though they offered more, theyâre still paying a lot less than the next person in line who tried to get the same type of home. Alas, more is less!Â If youâre thinking about buying or selling, or you have any topics for me to cover in my next video, please reach out to me via phone or email.",

        "content": "Whether youâre a buyer or seller, you need a team to help you achieve your real estate goals.How will a team help you get to the top?Before I answer that question, allow me to share a quick story. In March 2018, one of my extended team membersâmy business coachâtold me he wanted to climb Mount Aconcagua, the tallest peak in South America, later that December and wanted to know if Iâd come along. Iâd always been an avid outdoorsman and loved camping, but Iâd never heard of Mount Aconcagua, so I told him Iâd have to learn more about it first.Â After doing a little research, I learned that climbing Mount Aconcagua would be a 14-day expedition. Thatâs when I thought, âThereâs no way I can do this.â I couldnât just disconnect from my life for 14 days. Then, he told me that it would actually last 20 days.Â Long story short, I did it, and the reason why was the team that was assembled to guide us on the expedition. Thereâs an important lesson here that applies to buying or selling a home.Â To put this into perspective, you can see a picture of me and three of my friends at 1:45 in the video hiking from camp one to camp two on the mountain. This was around day nine, and it gives you a good idea of how extreme the situation was. You might look at this photo and think, âWow, what an epic picture,â but what you donât see is the 30 others that helped my team and me get to that point. We had three expert guides assigned to us to make sure we got to the top, but we didnât know there would also be many others who were in charge of making sure we had an amazing experience.Â âYou want to work with an agent who has a staff dedicated to making sure the experience is efficient, pleasurable, and successful.âFrom the medical team to the porters to the mules to the kitchen staff, we had so many people helping us get to the top, and we wouldnât have been able to get that photo without them.Â Buying a home can be a scary decision, but itâs also very exciting. However, if you donât have the right team on your side, you wonât get from where you are to where you want to be. You also wonât have a good experience. The same goes for sellers, whether youâre liquidating your assets or transitioning into a bigger home.Â No matter what, these are big mountains to climb, and itâs important to understand that 90% of all agents in Orange County are solo agents. They do everything themselves. Could I have climbed Mount Aconcagua with just one other person? Itâs not impossible, but most people get to the top because they have a team of trained professionals helping them every step of the way.Â I donât think I couldâve made it to the top with just one other person; the team is what helped me. There is a lot that goes into buying or selling a home, so you want to work with an agent who has a staff dedicated to making sure the experience is efficient, pleasurable, and successful. You also need a team that works with extended team members like title and escrow officers, handymen, contractors, etc.Â So if youâre thinking of buying or selling in Orange County and you want to know how my team and I can help you get to the top, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Weâd love to work with you.",

        "content": "The highest price you can get for your home sale changes depending on the market. Hereâs where weâre at right now.I work with a lot of homeowners who are interested in selling their properties, and one of the biggest challenges Iâve found is that many of these people struggle with selling their property for less than what it has sold for in the past. Let me explain.The market hit its peak in 2018, and we saw a shift starting to happen in 2019. In some areas of Orange County, homes are selling for less than they would have earlier in the year or back in 2018. The market is shifting based on interest rates, the upcoming election, and more.Â What Iâm trying to help you understand is this: Sometimes, less is more. If a home in your neighborhood sold for $1 million six months ago and youâre thinking about selling, it can be hard to digest the fact that homes arenât selling for that much right now. If youâre a seller out there, this doesnât seem to make sense.Â âIt could always be worse.âWhat I always tell my clients is that a home is worth whatever a buyer is willing to pay for it. A buyer is always willing to pay what they think a home is worth based on how they feel when they walk through it, the active inventory in the area, and what they know other homes have sold for in the past.The best advice I can give to sellers is to have an open mind, consider all the different factors involved when youâre selling a property, and let go of the number thatâs in your mind; focus on the number that the home is worth in the market today. Itâs natural that you feel like youâre leaving a little more money on the table, but realize that buyers arenât always willing to pay what a seller wants, depending on the market.Â It could always be worse. Taking a slightly lower offer earlier on in the process could be a better decision than waiting for a better offer, because that better offer might not come.If you have any questions for me about selling a home or real estate in general, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Although many homebuyers out there are concerned about the market, they shouldnât be. Hereâs why.If youâre a homebuyer, Iâm sure you have some concerns about whatâs going on in the market. Itâs probably nothing new to you, but I think itâs something we should continually discuss in order to control the narrative. If youâre watching TV, you need to understand that their job is to sell excitement and ads. Therefore, they will always be talking about doom and gloom.Â The same goes for social media. Lately, itâs been a lot of talk about the âimpending recessionâ and the âlooming housing crisis.â 57% of buyers believe that a recession will affect the housing market as bad as or worse than in 2007 and 2008. The data just doesnât support that, but at the end of the day, thatâs the mindset of the buyer community in general.I like to operate with no emotion when it comes to making real estate decisions. If it makes sense for me financially, I want to put a plan together to make it happen. At the same time, buying a home can be a very emotional thing. If you can grasp what youâre getting into, you should be able to eliminate a lot of that fear.Interest rates are still hovering at a very low level. The cost to buy money is historically low right now. Home prices are beginning to flatten out in some areas, drop in others, and rise in others. Weâre seeing that a lot of buyers in this market are afraid to submit strong offers because they donât want a recession to impact prices or their own financial situation. Uncertainty creates fear, which creates doubt, which creates paralysis. A lot of buyers right now who can afford to buy are afraid to do so.âThe data doesnât support most peopleâs concerns.âIf youâre thinking about buying, hereâs my advice. First, connect with a great local real estate agent. If youâre in the Orange County area and you want to connect with me or my team, please send me an email or contact the office. Iâd love to help you figure out a way to find out what you want. If you arenât in the area but need a referral somewhere else, I can connect you with an agent in that market who will do just as good a job for you.Next, you need to find a lender who can help you understand what it takes to buy a home in this market. At the end of the day, you need to understand what the lender is looking for. First, theyâre looking at your credit, your income, and your assets. They want to make sure that you have the ability to pay the money back that you borrow and the collateral that you have.If you do both of these things, regardless of whether the market goes up, down, or stays flat, owning a home will be one of the best long-term investments youâll ever make. Even if the market goes down after you buy, it will come back up eventually. Itâs not a flip-and-profit market. Knowledge is power.If you have any questions for me about the home buying process or anything else related to real estate, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "My five reasons why it may be a wonderful time to sell your home.Is now a great time to sell? Are you a seller trying to time the market perfectly? Honestly, itâs impossible to time the market just right. For most of my clients who have timed the market perfectly, it was simply luck.Â As we approach the holidays, clients say theyâre a bit concerned: Thanksgiving is around the corner, Christmas is coming up, New Yearâs, elections, and so on. They ask, âDo you think we should wait until next year? Do you think weâll be able to get more for our home?â I tell everyone the same thing: I donât have a crystal ball. All I can do is provide the best guidance based on the market now, present my estimations of whatâs going to happen, and what Iâm seeing in the market place, but itâs never a guarantee.Â I have five reasons why selling now is potentially better than selling in the future. Itâs a wonderful time to sell right now. However, remember: This is your home, you donât have to sell it, you donât have to accept any offer. Even if an offer comes in at full price, you donât ever have to accept it. So, letâs do what we need to do to prepare the home, and if we get an awesome price when we list it, then greatâyou were able to fulfill your goals. If for some reason we canât get an awesome price for your home, weâll try again in the new year, but at least you gave it a try and there are no regrets.Â âItâs impossible to time the market just right.âHere are the five reasons itâs favorable to sell right now:1. Less competition. Many people think that itâs a bad time to sell right now, and without consulting a real estate agent to learn their options, theyâre deciding to list in the new year. Those sellers will not be your competition right now.Â 2. We know the market now. We know that right now the market is wonderful, so letâs take advantage of it!3. Rates are historically low. Buyers are still submitting offers on properties and many homes are receiving multiple offers, which means thereâs still a lot of demand for excellent homes.Â 4. Buyers have more time to look. People have more time to look for homes during the holidays. They often have time off for each holiday coming up. When buyers have time off, thatâs when they want to go see homes. Right now presents a wonderful opportunity for them to look at properties.Â 5. Buyers are motivated during the holidays. If buyers werenât motivated, theyâd be spending time with their family, traveling, or doing other things. They wouldnât be searching for homes. They have a clear reason to be looking during the holidays; maybe tax reasons, to buy before the end of the year, and so on.Â Finally, if youâve made it this far, I want to give you a bonus tip!Â 6. Take a chance! Most people are not going to list now; they plan on listing in 2020. If you list in the new year thereâs going to be much more competition, much less demand. If youâre thinking about selling, speak to an agent, understand your options, take a chance. If you donât get what you want, you always have 2020.Â If you ever want to talk about your options, please email or call me. I would love to help you. If you have any video ideas you want me to talk about in the future, send those my way as well.",

Whether the home was withdrawn, canceled, or expired, you may still need to sell.Â Whatâs probably happening is youâre getting battered with mail, texts, emails, and phone calls from dozens of agents telling you why theyâre the best, why your last agent was horrible, and why theyâre the ones who can help you achieve your goals. There are 16,000 agents in Orange County and last year only 400 of them sold 10 homes or more. 95% to 98% of these agents that are contacting you do not have the expertise required to help you get your home sold for the best price and in the time you want it because they havenât been in the business long enough. This is not a favorable market for someone who does not have a strategy.Â You want to make sure that you do your due diligence. If you are speaking to different agents you should be asking the right questions. Many agents are calling because they want your listing, but what youâre likely looking for are options. âWhy didnât my home sell? What is the next step? What can I do differently to get my home sold? Who should I hire?âÂ âThis is not a favorable market for someone who does not have a strategy.âTalk to a few agents to assess how you can do better. My team and I specialize in assisting clients to sell their homes when previous agents failed. The one thing we pride ourselves on is that we arenât calling because we want your listing but because we want to help. When we are offering help, weâll walk you through different potential scenarios to present you with options.Â In this market, sometimes you have to get inventive. Interest rates are great, homes are still selling for amazing prices, but buyers are dubious. The recession is coming, thatâs the talk of the town. So what can we do to design a listing strategy thatâs going to be ârecession-proofâ?Â If you tried to sell in the past and werenât successful send me an email or call me, weâd love to lay out all of your options.

        "content": "Buyers: Are you too focused on the price of the home rather than your monthly payment? Letâs discuss this.When considering your budget for buying a home, are you concentrating on price or monthly payment? Early in my career one of my mentors told me that price is a one-time thing but monthly payments are a monthly thing. Thatâs whatâs going to determine your affordability.Â Many times the buyers we meet are sticking to a specific number when the truth is that different loan programs can offer you different price options. Based on your risk tolerance, you could potentially afford more home and still have a lower monthly payment.Â âPrice is a one-time thing but monthly payments are a monthly thing.âAnother thing I want buyers to consider is that many people are talking about a recession. There are areas in Orange County where we have begun to see some prices dropping. Many clients ask, âIf the prices are going down why donât we just wait until they drop 3% to 5% and then buy?â The reason why that may not be the best approach is that interest rates play a huge role in what your monthly payment will be. Every time the rates go up 1%, property values fall 10%. What you may find is that the rates will go up higher and faster than the property values will come down. So you could get stuck buying a home for a better price but actually have a higher monthly payment, which doesnât make sense.Â As a buyer, the best option for you, no matter when youâre thinking of buying, is to speak to a lender. There are no costs, obligations, or strings attached. A lender can offer you more options. Options help us assess what the next best step moving may be for you.Â If youâre a buyer and you want to talk to a lender please call or send me an email. We would love to open up our network to help you figure out what your next step might be. If you have any video ideas you want me to talk about in the future, send those my way!",

        "content": "Many people think that facts and figures are the best way to judge the market, but thereâs more to the story than this. Letâs discuss.Often when people think about the state of our real estate market, they tend to take into account the obvious factors like the number of available homes, the political climate, local employment trends, and other such points of interest. However, what people sometimes fail to consider is that there are also many external factors at play.Â Donât get me wrong: Keeping trends like interest rates and appreciation rates in mind is certainly a good idea, but itâs also important to account for human error. Even real estate professionals can sometimes get the facts wrong. Letâs say youâre thinking of selling, but have been dragging your feet on making a move. By the time you get around to listing, there are suddenly four or five other properties for sale in your neighborhood. As unlikely as this might sound, it happens. There is no way to precisely predict whatâs going to happen in our marketâespecially on a hyperlocal level.Â National trends only reflect the average direction of various market conditions. Even though prices are rising across the country, overall, for example, prices are flattening out and even decreasing in certain areas of Orange County.Â âThereâs simply no way to predict how the human element of our market will impact local real estate.âThe bottom line is to take reports from the media with a grain of salt. The facts and figures that come out about our market only tell part of the story. Thereâs simply no way to predict how the human element of our market will impact local real estate. Numbers donât solely dictate the marketâbuyers, sellers, homeowners, and real estate agents play a major role, as well.Â Thankfully, even in light of recent recession rumors, our current market is still going strong. Inventory is plentiful and interest rates are low, meaning buyers have a lot of properties to choose from and have greater purchasing power to leverage during their search. This benefits sellers, as well.Â Even if our economy begins to slow, this doesnât mean the housing market will do the same. In fact, many experts predict that home prices will continue to rise over the next 12 to 24 months, depending on where you live.Â All in all, now is the time to connect with a Realtor (like myself) to talk about your real estate goals in relation to whatâs happening now.

First of all, you have to work with the right agent and the right team to make sure they assist you in executing your plan.If you donât have an agent though, you should know that are two keys to getting top dollar for your home: its list price and how it shows.Â About 92% of all buyers will see your home online before they visit it, and if it doesnât look great online, they might not want to see it in person. More importantly, buyers are very picky when it comes to what theyâre willing to spend money on these days, and buyer demand has dropped since it peaked earlier in the year. This is why you must price your home strategically.âAbout 92% of all buyers will see your home online before they visit it, and if it doesnât look great online, they might not want to see it in person.âOftentimes, the list price my team and I set for our clients isnât necessarily the price we want to sell the home forâitâs the bait. What can we do knowing that every buyer wants a good deal? How can we price a home so that it gives buyers the impression that itâs a great deal? Also, how can we maximize its exposure? We know that if more buyers see your home, you have a better chance of attracting multiple offers. If your homeâs price is aggressive and attractive, theyâll want to see it.Â Thatâs just step one, though, because if they walk in your door and donât see something they love, that will lead to a huge disconnect. Thatâs why the next step is to make your home look like a model home. It should look so nice that buyers fall in love with it instantaneously and feel compelled to make an offer. If you can make more than one buyer feel that way, you have a multiple-offer situation on your hand. All thatâs left is to see whoâs willing to pay the most for your home.Â If youâd like to know more about selling your home for top dollar or you have any other real estate questions I can answer, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

Hereâs why.If you tried selling your home in the recent past and your listing was withdrawn, canceled, or expired, youâre probably thinking youâd rather wait until 2020 to try listing again.Â I talk to about 20 people a day who are in the same situation, and half of them say the same thingâeither the market was no good, they didnât get the price they wanted, or the holiday season is coming up and they donât want to deal with it.Â Waiting until the new year to list may be the right approach, but today I want to share a few reasons why it may not be. Right now, the market still has a lot of juice left for sellers. Although weâre experience a market shift, with the right strategy, you can recreate a great market for your home sale and earn a record price.Â If you wait until next year to sell, youâll face a couple challenges. First of all, a lot of other sellers want to wait until the new year to list, too. What do you think will happen if you wait until the new year to put your home on the market and all those other sellers do the same thing? Thatâs rightâthere will be a lot of inventory. More inventory means buyers have more choices, and when buyers have more choices, demand falls. When demand falls, you may net significantly less from your home sale than you would if you listed when there wasnât as much inventoryâespecially in a shifting market.Â âRight now, the market still has a lot of juice left for sellers.âSo before you make a final decision, do yourself a favor: Reach out to a few agents and see what theyâd be able to do for you if you listed again this year. It doesnât cost you a thing and there are no obligations. If you meet with a few agents and then decide you still would rather wait until next year to sell, at least you did your due diligence. Who knows, you may find out that selling this year really does represent a better opportunity for you.Â In any case, the worst thing you can do is go into autopilot in terms of selling next year, find out itâs not a great market, and then regret the fact that you waited.Â If youâre looking for a fresh, modern approach to selling your home in 2019, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Buying a new home in our market means you may need to sacrifice. Hereâs what I mean by that.What are you willing to sacrifice in order to buy a new home?As our market tightens and shifts, buyers and sellers tend to get pickier. In the last few months, weâve seen transactions where both parties came to a standstill during negotiations when they were just a few thousand dollars apart. I always tell my clients that if theyâre spending upwards of $750,000 or $1 million on a property, a few thousand dollars shouldnât stand in the way of them getting what they want.Â A lot of us, thoughâmyself includedâspend money on things that donât help our bottom line. For example, letâs say you buy a $5 Starbucks coffee for 15 days out of every month. That equates to $75 youâre spending each month on Starbucks coffee when you could be saving close to that amount by just making coffee at home.Â âThink about what youâre willing to sacrifice for the greater good.âIf you were to spend an extra $10,000 on the home you want, your monthly mortgage payment would increase between $60 and $75 anyway, so think about what youâre spending money on that you could potentially eliminate so that you can give yourself a better chance at affording that home.Â In other words, think about what youâre willing to sacrifice for the greater good.Â If you have any more questions about this or any other real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to speak with you. Until then, happy selling!",

        "author": "",

        "content": "What is a recession and how does it actually influence our real estate market?To answer the first question, a recession is when the GDP falls for two consecutive quarters. Sometimes it lasts just those two quarters, sometimes it lasts longer.Â To answer the second question, letâs look at some historical data. In 1980, we went through a recession and home prices appreciated by 6.1%. In 1981, we were still in the same recession, and once again, home prices appreciatedâthis time to the tune of 3.5%. In 1991, there was another recession, and home prices dropped just 1.9%. Then in 2001, during another recession, home prices rose 6.6%.As you can see, thereâs a trend here: Just because we go through a recession, it doesnât mean home prices will fall. In fact, in three of the five recessions weâve been through in the past 40 years, home prices went up.âIn three of the five recessions weâve been through in the past 40 years, home prices went up.âThe last recession we went through, as you might guess, was back in 2008, and home prices dropped 19.7%. The difference between that recession and all the others, though, is that it was caused specifically by the housing market. The market was naturally inflated by all the bad loans handed out.Â So if youâre a buyer or a seller sitting on the fence waiting to see if prices fall or the market crashes, let me put your mind at ease. Despite what the media might have you believe, real economists anticipate a 3% to 4% appreciation in the next couple of years. Will the market shift at some point? Absolutelyâthe market is always correcting itself. The only way youâll time the market, though, is if you get lucky.Â If youâre a buyer waiting for the recession to hit so you can get an amazing deal, thatâs probably not going to happen. If youâre waiting for a better deal, that might happen, but donât forget about interest rates. You might be able to get a home at a better price if you wait a couple of years, but if interest rates go from 3.5% to 5% during that time, youâll still pay more per month for the same house.Â If youâd like to talk more about this topic or youâre thinking of buying or selling a home soon, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you. Until then, happy selling!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If you search for properties online, youâll notice that most third-party sites (Trulia, Redfin, Zillow, etc.) offer some type of automated home valuation. By using valuations like Zillowâs Zestimate, you can get an idea of what your home is worth. However, theyâre not as accurate as you might think.Â To clarify, most agents donât like sites like Zillow because they can be considered a disruptor of the industry, but Iâm a fan of them because I like the fact that so much information is transparent. I think this benefits sellers tremendously because, before these sites existed, Realtors held all the information. Many times, this information wouldnât get to the right people and cause homes to sell for less than what they were worth.Â So why the message about their inaccuracy? We put a North Tustin home on the market recently, and we were surprised by how big the difference was between its automated valuation and its real value. Itâs located in a neighborhood where homes are selling between $1.2 million and $2 million, but Zillow said it was worth $847,000, while Redfin said it was worth over $1.3 million. Thatâs a $500,000 gap.Â As my business partner Ryan McMillan says, Zillowâs Zestimate is beneficial in that it allows consumers to gauge how much a property is worth, but they donât take into account the fact that itâs an algorithm. You canât really know what a home is worth until you take into consideration the state of the market, the homeâs condition, and other factors. This is why consulting a real estate professional is the best way to determine your homeâs value.Â âWhat a home is worth on paper and what a Realtor can sell it for are two very different things, which is why you must hire a Realtor to accurately assess your homeâs value.âZillow claims that their Zestimate has a 10% margin of error, meaning itâll value a $1 million home for anywhere from $900,000 to $1.1 million. This is because, as we already said, itâs an algorithm that canât account for a lot of important factors.Â We consider seven to 10 different factors before pricing a home for the market, and a homeâs worth can also be altered based on the strategy the seller uses to get it sold. If you overprice your home, it might sit on the market and cause you to sell for less than what itâs worth. If you underprice it, you might create an auction effect that causes it to sell above its list price.Â To summarize, what a home is worth on paper and what a Realtor can sell it for are two very different things, which is why you must hire a Realtor to accurately assess your homeâs value.Â On a final note, keep in mind that when you list your home on Zillow, you have the ability to alter its criteria and modify its Zestimate based on its condition. Donât be afraid to take advantage of this and make sure your homeâs valuation is as accurate as possible. If you need help with this, please let us know.Â If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you.",

        "content": "Are you having trouble selling your home? Or did your listing expire recently without being sold?My business partner Ryan McMillan and I are experts at helping people sell their homes after their previous agent was unsuccessful. Part of our daily schedule involves calling homeowners whose listings either expired or were canceled and asking them if they want to try again. Relisting a home that was previously on the market requires a different strategy, and weâve perfected that craft over the last two years.Â When we make these calls, a lot of former sellers blame price as the culprit behind their failed home sale. The shift in the market also gets some of the blame. However, some sellers also blame their agent, which leads us to believe that not all agents are the same in terms of doing everything they can to expose their sellersâ properties to the marketâa big part of the home sale process.Â In fact, when we research failed home sales, we oftentimes find out that the price was spot on, so the marketing or preparation couldnât have been very good. As youâve heard me say before, there are three things that get a home sold: price, preparation, and exposure (i.e., the marketing your agent does to get the word out).Â âAbout 35% of all home sellers who come off the market still need to sell, so if you fall into this category, please get in touch with us.âSo if the price isnât to blame for your home failing to sell, you have to ask how your home showed, how accessible it was, how it âfeltâ as buyers came through it, and what your agent did to get the word out about it.Â About 35% of all home sellers who come off the market still need to sell, so if you fall into this category, please get in touch with us. We want to learn more about what was done to try and get your home sold and offer our expert advice and fill in the blanks. We want to know more about your goals, because nine times out of 10, we have a solution for you.Â Getting in touch, in this case, is the hardest part, because owners of expired listings can get anywhere from 60 to 100 phone calls. This makes agents like us, who truly want to help you, a needle in the haystack. We know it can be overwhelming to have all this attention from other agents, but having options is good, and itâs worth a shot to give someone the chance to present a different approach to your home sale.Â The fact is, not all agents are created equal. Thereâs no minimum standard in this industryâall you have to do to become a real estate agent is take a couple of classes and get your license. Some agents are great at what they do; others have no idea what theyâre doing. Unless you interview multiple candidates to sell your home, you might get stuck with one who doesnât do a good job for you. Fortunately, thatâs where we come in.If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me. My team and I would love to help you.",

        "content": "If youâre thinking of buying a homeâwhether youâre upgrading or downsizingâhome inspections are a critical part of the process. Theyâre there so you know whatâs going on with the property and there are no surprises during or after escrow. You want to know everything about a property before you buy it, right?As a buyer, you have the right to do any inspection you want for the home youâre buying. On my team, we usually start with a general inspection and go wherever that leads us. Unless the general inspection comes back free and clear of any issues (which rarely happens), weâll move onto mold inspections, electrical inspections, plumbing inspections, etc. Â What does the inspection process look like, though?In California, homes are sold as is, and by that we mean in a visual sense. In other words, if you can see whatâs going on with the homeâs current condition, your offer should reflect this. We do home inspections specifically because you canât always see whatâs going on inside a property. We donât want our clients to buy something only to find out later on that itâs in need of repair.Â To prepare his clients for the inspection process, my business partner Ryan McMillan first explains what inspections are for. In addition to minimizing surprises, inspections also minimize future costs. At the Robert Mack Group, our goal is to create a seamless home buying experience for our clients and give them peace of mind. Buying a home is a stressful time for some people, because not everyone has the money to tackle every repair or upgrade that needs to be made.âAs a buyer, you have the right to do any inspection you want for the home youâre buying.âThere are a couple things home inspections provide you that you need to be aware of.The first is awareness. The seller doesnât have to make any repairs or offer any credits (more on that below), so if you become aware of certain issues and the seller doesnât agree to repair them or offer a credit for them, you have to decide whether you still feel comfortable buying at the current price.Â The second is theÂ request for repairs. If you come across an issue thatâs a safety or health hazard, you can make a request for repair or use a credit form and negotiate a solution with the seller so youâre not stuck dealing with the issue yourself. This can go both ways. If youâre getting a good deal on the property, the seller might not be inclined to make the repair or offer credit. If youâre paying at or over list price, they might reconsider.Â Every situation is different, and everything is negotiable. Thereâs no one-size-fits-all method to handling inspections. When you work with the Robert Mack Group, though, weâve got you covered. We have anywhere from 11 to 13 inspectors on our vendor list who we can call to make sure youâre protected during your purchase and your home is in good shape.Â If you have any questions about this or any other real estate topic, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Weâre deep into summertime in our Orange County market, which is usually the most active selling season of the year, but not necessarily the best time to buy or sell (like many people assume).Â So is it a good time for you to buy or sell or should you wait? Letâs look at a few numbers to find out.Â Over the last three to five years, inventory has been lowâusually anywhere from one to three months. Lately, though, weâve jumped into more of a two-to-six month range. A ânormalâ market is considered to have six monthsâ worth of inventory, so although weâre still in a sellerâs market, things are becoming more normalized. This increase in inventory is in-line with how most economists describe the market.This trend is also impacting home values. In the recent past, we experienced high appreciation rates, but moving forward, home prices should start appreciating at a rate of 3% to 5%.Â When inventory increases and homes start taking longer to sell, it means demand is falling. Since buyers have more homes to choose from, more time to make a decision, and interest rates are still historically low, nowâs a great time to buy. Three or four years ago, I remember homes going under contract a day after being listed, but thatâs not the case anymore in Orange County.Â âIf you can negotiate a great price on the property you want (which thereâs a good chance of), youâll also get an amazingly low interest rate.âAs one of my mentors used to tell me, âIn real estate, price is a one-time thingâinterest rates are what affect your monthly payment.â If you can negotiate a great price on the property you want (which thereâs a good chance of), youâll also get an amazingly low interest rate. If you wait a year or two to buy, you might not get that same great rate.Â Another unique statistic Iâve found is that inventory has only increased about 15% county-wide since the start of summer. Usually during this period, inventory grows by 25% to 30%. This confirms the fact that homes are taking longer to sell.Â If youâre a seller, remember that there are three reasons homes sell: price, preparation, and exposure (i.e., marketing). Now more than ever, you must put an attractive price tag on your home when you list it. If itâs not compelling, itâs not selling. Weâre learning that buyers donât want to spend too much more than what the last home in your area sold for, so keep that in mind as well.Â Every micro-marketâs different, so if you have any questions about whatâs happening in your specific neighborhood or youâre thinking of buying or selling, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to be a resource to you or anyone you know.Â Until thenâhappy selling!",

        "content": "If youâre in the process of buying a home, what kind of inspections should you order during the contingency period?A lot of agents will hire a general home inspector during this time and proceed based on their report, but the situation isnât always as cut and dry as that. What kind of specific inspections should you order to guarantee there are no surprises after escrow closes, then? To give you an idea, Iâll tell what kind of inspections my team and I order for our buyers in this situation.Â If youâre looking to buy a condo, the answer is pretty straightforward. You donât own the exterior of the building and the roof and foundation are likely owned by the homeowners association, so you really only need a general inspection. That being said, if our buyerâs inspector recommends that we hire an electrician, plumber, etc., to address any issues they canât identify, weâll take that next step.Â âIf the general inspector finds a problem with the electrical or plumbing system, they may recommend a specialist, but these are the three inspections we start with.âIf youâre buying a single-family property, things get a little trickier. We do a minimum of three inspections for our buyers in this situationâespecially if the home was built before the year 2000. The first is the general inspection, which will help us understand the inner workings of the property. Next, weâll order a roof inspectionâa roof is an expensive item, so you definitely want to know if there are any problems with it.Â After that, weâll order a sewer line inspection. This is an inspection that very few agents do, but if youâre buying an older home, you need to understand that, up until the point that it connects to the city, your homeâs sewer line is your responsibility.Â Again, if the general inspector finds a problem with the electrical or plumbing system, they may recommend a specialist, but these are the three inspections we start with.Â If you have any more questions about this topic or you have a topic in mind youâd like to see me address in a future video, donât hesitate to reach out to me.",

In other words, the economy is not in as good a position as you might think. This development does bring some good news, though. Namely, interest rates are expected to soon reach figures never before seen in real estate history. And low rates mean a high level of opportunity for homebuyers. Even a small change in interest rates can greatly impact affordability.Low interest rates mean great things for sellers, as well. Although there still isnât a lot of inventory, throngs of buyers have been incentivized to make a move as a result of these low rates. In other words, demand has shot up despite the current lack of supply. However, this might not continue to be the case if supply grows significantly over the next few months. We will see a shift in the market eventually, whether it comes in six, 12, or 18 months. And when this shift occurs, prices will likely flatten out.Â âWhen rates are low, itâs a great time to buy or sell.âSo could you potentially buy a home for less money if you waited a year to make a move? Maybe. But keep in mind that rates might be higher at that point. If interest rates rise even by 1%, your buying power will drop 10%. So even if you buy a home for less, your monthly payment will be more.With all of this in mind, the first step you should take when youâre considering buying is to speak with a lender. If you can qualify to buy now, I believe youâll get a better rate today than you would 12 months from now.The bottom line of todayâs message is this: When rates are low, itâs a great time to buy or sell.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to discuss your real estate goals, feel free to give me and my team a call or send us an email.

Itâs not for homeowners who canceled their listing because of personal reasons.If you follow my blog, you know that Iâve said that pricing plus preparation plus exposure equals a record-price sale. If youâve tried to sell in the past and failed, hereâs what I want you to do: I want you to audit your experience. First, think about the price that you set for your property. Was it fair? Was it based on your current competition and what they were selling for?If your price was fine and you still didnât sell, maybe you didnât prepare your home well enough to sell. When we take a listing, our goal is to put out the highest quality product. In a perfect world, weâd stage every home to attract buyers and make them fall in love, but we canât always do that. You have to do what you can within your resources to put out the highest quality product.âI want you to audit your experience.âWhen you previously listed your home, was it clean? Was it decluttered? Thatâs another missing link that can turn buyers off even if the price is right.The final missing link is the exposure that your property had. Maybe you hired an inexperienced agent who didnât have a strategy in place to sell your property.If your home came off the market, but you still want to sell it, you have to ask yourself what was the missing link: pricing, condition, or your agent?If the agent was your problem, itâs time to find a new agent who can help you achieve your goals of selling for a record price. Our team specializes in selling homes like these so if you or someone you know is thinking about relisting any time in the near future, donât hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today Iâm talking to the homeowners out there who either need more or less space than what they currently have in their home. Right now, itâs a fantastic time to consider upgrading or downsizing for a few reasons.First, interest rates are now below 4%. While itâs obvious why this is good for buyers, itâs also good news for sellers. The more buyers that qualify for a home in your price range, the better the chances are of you selling for a great price. More and more buyers are entering the current market, qualifying for more, and having a lower monthly payment. Theyâre actively and aggressively looking for homes.Second, inventory for great properties is still really low. As supply goes up, demand falls. Our supply is still extremely low, so demand is still high. When you combine that with the low interest rates, itâs the perfect time for you to get your home sold for top dollar.âRight now, you can sell high and buy low.âHereâs the kicker and why it makes sense to downsize or upgrade right now: Inventory is going to significantly rise in the next few months. Right now, you can sell your home for a record price, then when youâre ready to buy after that, youâre going to be in a position where you have a lot more options and a lot more control in the transaction. Youâre probably going to find a great deal.Everyone likes to sell high and buy low and our real estate market is set up perfectly for doing so right now. If you or someone you know is in a position to make a move, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

Hereâs what I tell everyone that I come across: First of all, you can never time the market perfectly. Second of all, if youâre not an investor, donât think like one. Youâre buying a home to live in and there are so many benefits to doing so. If you want to buy a house and you can afford to buy a house, then you should buy a house.The great thing about low interest rates is that when youâre buying a property, itâs never about the purchase price. Itâs about the monthly payment. Whether you pay $5,000 more or $5,000 less than you wanted to, at the end of the day, what matters is your monthly payment. The lower the interest rate you have, the lower your payment will be. If that number is within your comfort zone with these low rates, then now is the time to buy.âThere are plenty of options for buyers in all price ranges.âInventory is growing right now in the summer months and buyers have opportunities to look at multiple homes before making a decision. It doesnât matter whether youâre in the $200,000 or $5 million price pointâthere are plenty of options for you.

        "content": "Hereâs the million-dollar question Iâve been hearing lately: âHow is the market doing?âHonestly, Iâm not a huge fan of this question because every homebuyer and seller has a different need and a different goal, and chances are theyâre not all looking in the same market. So today Iâm bringing you a very general update on the state of the Orange County market as a whole:1. Weâve seen a year-over-year rise in inventory. Currently, we have 29% more homes available than we did at this time last year. This means more options for buyers and more competition for sellers. When buyers have more options, they have more time to think about want they want to buy. More competition for sellers generally means that demand for any unique or specific property drops a little bit. If youâre a seller in the market, make sure that your home is priced appropriately because if itâs not, then the market will probably react in a way that wonât benefit you.2. The average days on market has increased. Last year at this time, it took an average of 63 days to sell a property in Orange County; today weâre looking at 84 days. In addition, 14% fewer homes are selling now compared to last year.3. Expired listings have increased by 64%. An expired listing is a home that was listed on the market that failed to sell for one reason or another. Around 64% more homes are expiring now than they were last year. In our market, weâve noticed that about 40% of listed homes are failing to sell. However, itâs important to understand that the market is going through a bit of a shift at the moment. Donât be fooled by media reports of our being in a buyerâs marketâweâre still in a very strong sellerâs market.âThe statistics may seem to spell doom and gloom for sellers, but they need to understand that with the right strategy and the right agent, you can still sell your home for a record price.â4. Sellers need to showcase a high-quality product in order to sell for top dollar. This means that youâll need to put forth the time, energy, and money to prepare your house to show like a model homeâdo some minor repairs, make sure the house is clean, and have it staged to get top dollar.In addition to preparing the home to show in its best light, you also need to price your home to attract the highest number of buyers and work with an agent who can maximize your listingâs exposure to make sure that every buyer in the market for a home knows about your listing.Overall, the statistics may seem to spell doom and gloom for sellers, but they need to understand that with the right strategy and the right agent, you can still sell your home for a record price.For buyers, there are many overpriced properties and thereâs a lot of stale inventory. With interest rates being as low as they are, you can definitely find a great deal in Orange County.If youâre interested in buying or selling a home and would like to learn more about how the market relates to your unique situation, donât hesitate to reach out to me and my team.

A surefire way to sabotage your own sale is to present the home as is in its listing photosâespecially if itâs in a cluttered and untidy state. Nevertheless, I see so many would-be sellers commit this major misstep, which results in their home going unsold.Â With hundreds of thousands of dollars on the line, itâs important to make buyers feel as though your home will be a worthwhile investment.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Price + prep + exposure = record price. This equation is the focus of todayâs topic.Before we unpack each element, letâs consider some alarming market statistics that illustrate the dilemma a lot of sellers are finding themselves in:  Two out of five homes sold in our market sell below their true potential.Â   Another two out of five homes fail to even sell. Â Â   Only one in five homes sells at or above market value. Â For our part, the last seven homes my team and I have sold have gone for a record priceâeven in the face of the current market slowdown. How did we get this done? For one thing, we recognize that the buyer will always have the last word when it comes to your homeâs valueânot you or me. As your listing agent, itâs my job to demonstrate to the buyer that your home is worth more than its market value.For most homebuyers, the decision of whether or not to make a purchase is rooted in emotion. It only makes sense that the more emotional a buyer becomes, the higher their offer will be.That leads me right into the first element of the previously mentioned equation: price. At the outset, you have to do your homework and work closely with your agent to set a fair asking price for your home. That includes looking at past sale prices and present competition, market trends, and interest rates. Then, youâll need to compare those findings to your homeâs location and condition.Â âPrice + prep + exposure = record price.âTaking all of that into account, arrive at a price thatâs fair not through your own lens, but through a buyerâs. Pricing high in hopes that thereâll be room for negotiation might seem like a strong strategy, but in reality, it wonât attract buyers to your home. The best way to entice buyers and increase your propertyâs exposure is to stay within the bounds of what buyers think your home is worth. Â Next, letâs talk about prep. I canât tell you how many listing pictures Iâve seen online that didnât light a fire under me at all, nor would they with prospective buyers. As a seller, understand that how your home is displayed online carries a lot of weight. Thatâs where 92% of buyers start their search nowadays, so if your homeâs photos are unattractive, buyers wonât take notice or want to view it in person.No matter what price range you fall into, you have to make buyers feel like your home is an investment thatâs well worth it for them. For as significant as this stage is, as many as 85% of sellers neglect it almost entirely.The final element in our equation is exposure. The exposure your home receives is only going to be as good as the agent you hire and their marketing. A great agent is going to maximize your homeâs exposure, both on and offline, and, as a result, widen your buyer pool.I hope you found value in todayâs message. If you know anyone whoâs thinking about selling their home, send it their way. If youâre thinking about doing the same and youâd like to talk about the selling process, Iâd love to have a conversation with you on the phone or in person. I hope to hear from you soon.

        "content": "Recently, a Harvard researcher studied consumers who were in the market to buy a drill bit. Ultimately, the study led to a curious discovery: In large part, it wasnât the drill bit that drew these people to the market; it was the drill bitâs utility.They simply needed something to make a hole in the wall, and the purpose of that hole was to hang a shelf. The study went on to say that it was about much more than the shelf for these consumers.This researcher concluded that the installation of a shelf brought about a greater sense of accomplishment, pride, and general tidiness in their living space.In the same way, we as real estate professionals have to probe a little deeper sometimes when our buyers give us a laundry list of amenities and details that are must-haves in their future home purchase. Perhaps they want the home to come with three bedrooms, a garage, and a lot of a certain size.âOn a deeper level, a buyer wants the homeâs features to collectively generate a feeling of accomplishment and pride.âFor us, though, it begs the question: Why do you want all of that? And more importantly, why do you want a home?After some digging, we learn that, much like the consumer in search of a drill bit, itâs about much more than the reasons that particular buyer gives. We discover that itâs less about the individual features themselves and more about what those features will provide for them.On a deeper level, a buyer wants the homeâs features to collectively generate a feeling of accomplishment and pride. All in all, a major part of the home search process is to enter it with the âbigger pictureâ in mind.If youâre thinking about buying a home and you want to get the process in motion, please reach out to me and my team.

        "category": "",
        "content": "For those thinking about purchasing a property in the near future, letâs take a moment to look at whatâs happening in our local real estate market.Right now, inventory is growing, which is good for buyers, because having more choices means two things:  Youâll have 20% to 30% more properties to choose from than you did just six months to a year ago.Â   The increase in available home options equals increased competition between sellers, which means the overall demand for properties falls.As a buyer, youâll also need to be aware of the fact that interest rates are at a 15-month low, meaning that youâre sitting pretty at the moment. If you speak with a lender and you feel comfortable with the monthly payment, my recommendation is to pull the trigger. Make it happen; based on prices and interest rates, thereâs no better time to get into the marketplace than right now.âIf the monthly payment doesnât make sense, then buying that home doesnât make sense.âBut the main point of my post today is to reframe the discussion around homebuying: Youâre not actually buying a home, but rather a monthly payment. Very early in my career, one of my mentors told me that the price of a home is a one-time thing, but your monthly payment is an every-month thing. Many buyers become fixated on the price of a home, but what if you could get the same property with a better loan and save money each month you make a house payment?Even though buying a home right now presents a great opportunity, you still need to speak with a lender first so that you understand what type of loan youâll be getting, how much youâll need to put down on a home, what your closing costs will be, and most importantly, what your total monthly payment will be. Knowing these things ahead of time will allow you assess how comfortable you are proceeding with that transaction. As a buyer, donât become fixated on price. Price is a guideline for us to show you homes that fall in the range of your ideal monthly payment. At the end of the day, if the monthly payment doesnât make sense, then buying that home doesnât make sense.If youâre thinking about buying a property and would like us to help you find the best one money can buy, feel free to give me a call or send an email. I love to educate people on how to find the exact kind of home theyâre looking for.",

        "content": "Today I want to address something about our real estate market: The spring market is here in full force, and sellers need to act accordingly.We have seen inventory increase dramatically over the last three to four weeks. Looking at historical trends, I expect that weâll continue to see a rise in inventory through May, June, July, and August. That means the deeper we get into the summertime, the more competition youâll have as a seller.The great news is that homes are selling pretty quickly and for great prices. However, the ones that are selling the quickest and for the best prices are the ones that come onto the market strong. By âstrong,â I mean that sellers are working alongside great agents with effective marketing campaigns, and the home itself is a high-quality product with a fair price.Buyers in the market are excited to purchase because interest rates are historically low. Right now, theyâre at a 14- or 15-month low, hovering in the low 4s. If youâre getting a jumbo loan, those rates are even lower.Â âIf youâre a home seller, you only have one chance to truly make an impact in the market.âHowever, even though buyers are excited, that doesnât mean that theyâre going to overpay for a property. That means if youâre a home seller, you only have one chance to truly make an impact in the market.Those who have been following my blog know that there are three key aspects to selling a home:  Preparing the home to show like a modelÂ   Pricing the home aggressively to maximize exposureÂ   Working with an agent who has both a strong offline and online marketing campaign to make sure that the most buyers possible see your homeIf one of those three components is missing, you run the risk of either having your home sit idly on the market for longer than you want, selling for less than you want, or worseânot selling at all. Keep these three key components at the forefront of your mind and be sure to hire an agent whoâll get the job done.If youâre interested in learning more about how my team and I maximize exposure for the properties we list, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Is the market giving us a head fake? Before I can answer this question, I should first explain what I mean by âhead fake.âIf you had talked to me in the late summer/early fall of 2018, I would have said that home prices are falling. In fact, we hit such a lull in the fourth quarter that I was very curious about how the 2019 market would play out. We had seen such a massive shift in not only the number of home sales, but also how long they were taking to sell. At the time, it didnât look so hot.But the good news is that in February, we started to see a little bit of a pickup. The inventory for great homes was very limitedâyes, there were a lot of homes on the market, but many were overpriced and/or didnât show well. Homes that were fairly priced and showed well were just flying off the market.âWe see prices continuing to rise, and my team and I believe that homes will continue to appreciate through 2019 and maybe even through 2020.âNow, with interest rates being at a 14-month low and employment as strong as it is, weâre actually starting to see the market pick up steam. In fact, the last three homes that my team and I have sold, some of which had been listed with another agent, sold with multiple offers within a week. On top of that, those homes sold for more than what each of the prior homes sold for. This just wasnât happening in the fourth quarter of last year.So is our market going through a head fake? I think so. We see prices continuing to rise, and my team and I believe that homes will continue to appreciate through 2019 and maybe even through 2020.If youâre a seller who tried to sell in the last quarter of 2018 but didnât have a great experience, my team and I are experts at relisting, rebranding, and selling homes that were previously listed on the market and failed to sell.

        "content": "Homebuyers: Is now the time to buy, or are you better off waiting? This is a tough question, and the answer to it depends on the client.In fact, every time we get in touch with a new buyer that weâll potentially work with, we have a 30- to 40-minute face-to-face meeting in our office. This gives the buyer the opportunity to see if weâre the right fit for them as their agent, and gives us the opportunity to learn more about them: What are they looking for? What gets them excited about a house? Whatâs their price range? How will their life change if we find for them what they want?During that time, we can really come to understand whether or not itâs the right time for that client to buy. If youâve never been in contact with us, we canât really give you the best advice to help answer this question. That said, Iâll do my best in a general sense.The market is currently giving us a little bit of a head fake. Had you asked me what was going on in the market in August of last year, I would have said that prices are flattening out or falling in many areas, and that weâre starting to see signs of a shift toward a more normalized market where homes will still sell for fair prices, but we wonât see these massive 10% to 15% appreciation rates year over year.âIf you know that you want to buy in the next one or two years, buying now will likely result in you getting the lowest monthly payment.âAbout a month ago, however, we noticed yet another shift. Buyers are starting to feel comfortable with the new market norms, and with interest rates being at a 14-month low and employment as strong as it is, weâre actually starting to see home prices rise. In fact, the last three homes that my team and I have sold actually sold for not just above asking price, but also more than the last home sold.So, if youâre a buyer who is waiting for prices to fall or are concerned that the market is going to crash (causing you to hesitate on the market), you may find yourself waiting longer than you expected. It is my personal opinion that weâll see the market consistently appreciate year over year in the Orange County/Los Angeles area for the next one to three years.Ultimately, the questions for those who are considering waiting are: Do you want to buy a home? And, more importantly, can you afford to buy? How long can you wait before buying?If you know that you want to buy in the next one or two years, buying now will likely result in you getting the lowest monthly payment. But again, every situation is examined on a case-by-case basis. Generally speaking, though, if youâre thinking about buying, it may be a good idea to do so sooner than later, or you risk paying more over time.For those who are thinking of buying a home and would profit from a face-to-face conversation with my team and me, feel free to reach out to us. We can learn more about each other and better illuminate whether or not now is the right time for you to get out in the market.",

However, as Iâve learned more about their models and approaches, Iâve realized that they actually do fill a gap in the industry for a particular type of clientele. The difference between Redfin and Realtors like me is the type of clients we serve.To illustrate, letâs look at a Redfin review that I found online. The person gave Redfin five stars, the highest rating they could possibly give them. But when you read the personâs review, you start to learn a little more about how the company operates:âI think that Redfin is a great option for millennials and not such a great option for other generations. First of all, the millennial generation uses the internet heavily and we like to do things by ourselves. Redfin has a no hand-holding approach and mostly does all the paperwork for you. You can go on practically unlimited home searches and tour all these properties without feeling pressured. Why? Because Redfin has separate touring agents that handle the touring for you. Then you have your assigned agent who does the negotiations and paperwork. Your assigned agent, however, does not do any hand-holding, so be prepared to do a lot of research on buying a homeâmeaning you should be hyper-aware of what to look for when buying a home because no one will tell you.âThis review really shed some light on how Redfin operates; itâs a little like hiring a financial planner instead of using eTrade, or hiring a travel agent instead of going to Expedia, Travelocity, or Kayak.âIf my clients canât manage their extracurriculars on top of doing all the research necessary to buy or sell a home, then I would say that no, Redfin is probably not the right option for them.âNowadays, these sites allow people to do things on their own, and if youâre savvy and do your research, you may be able to get a great deal out of it.However, if you do that, youâll be spending a lot of your own time trying to figure it all out. Many people who arenât savvy with the internet may actually end up spending more or having it cost them more than if they would have hired a professional.Whether youâre a buyer or seller, you need to ask yourself, âWhat am I looking for?â When I talk to my clients about Redfin, I often tell them that if they hire Redfin or a similar limited-service brokerage, theyâll have to be very hands-on, doing much of the work on their own. Alternatively, they can hire me and my team, paying us slightly more, but they can still live their lives without having to do all this extra work.If my clients canât manage their extracurriculars on top of doing all the research necessary to buy or sell a home (including taking care of the pre-listing preparations in the event theyâre selling), then I would say that no, Redfin is probably not the right option for them.If you have any questions about the buying or selling process or if you want to learn more about how we operate in comparison to a limited service brokerage, please donât hesitate to reach out to me. Until that point: Happy selling!",

        "content": "When it comes to predicting the future of our market, I think everyoneâs crystal ball is a bit foggy right now.Last November, I would have told you that home prices would be flattening or falling. Though Iâm seeing the same signs right now, top economists predict weâll see a 3.6% year-over-year appreciation. There are a lot of factors that come into play, however, so itâs tough to tell. In some Orange County areas, home prices are going up and inventory is low. In other places, the opposite is true.Economist Steve Harney actually believes weâll be seeing appreciation rates of 4.6%, which is more than what was originally thought. So, whatâs going on, exactly?Thereâs no one-size-fits-all answer. Every homeowner, property, and market is unique. The only way youâll truly know what your home is worth in our market is to connect with a local Realtor. Theyâll have an in-depth knowledge of your area, and theyâll know exactly how to market and price your home correctly.âEvery homeowner, property, and market is unique.âWeâve recently seen an 11% increase in home sales month over month. Now that weâre in spring, I think weâre going to see this trend continue. If youâre a buyer waiting for prices to fall, you could be waiting for something that will never happen. Interest rates are at a 14-month low, so your best bet is to make a purchase and secure a great rate now.Is right now a good time to sell? Again, it depends on your situation. You may want to cash out now while the marketâs hot, or you may want to wait and see what happens. Either way, itâs best to speak with a local real estate professional to find out what works for you.If youâre looking to buy or sell or you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me.

Youâve probably been bombarded with phone calls from more agents than you can count claiming that theyâre the best fit for you, so who should you choose?Â Before I explain how to handle this scenario, let me tell you what not to do. As I mentioned earlier, you should never relist with the same agent who failed you before.I recently spoke with a woman who said she planned to do this, exactly, and my question to her was this: âWhat do you think your agent will do differently this time?ââThe last thing you want to do when relisting is to fail again.âShe, of course, didnât have an answer for this. Her only reasoning was that she was simply too busy to find and interview new agents.Donât get me wrong: I understand what itâs like to be busy. But if it meant getting your home sold, wouldnât it be worth finding just 30 to 45 minutes out of your day to interview new agents?The bottom line is that if youâve tried to sell in the past, interviewing two to four new agents will be essential to your future success.

        "content": "In February of 2018, I met with a client who was so ready to sell her home that she wouldâve done so the same day we spoke if possible.The only thing that had been holding her back until that point was the fact that her friends and family had been saying to wait until summer. They told her that by doing so, sheâd earn a better deal for her home.When she relayed this to me, though, I explained something her friends and family probably didnât consider. Summer may be a more active season for real estate, but this can actually work against those seeking to take advantage of the hot market conditions. Summer is actually the peak buying seasonânot the peak selling season.Why? Well, if everyone thinks they should wait until summer to list, those who do list at that time will be facing a lot of competition. And the more homes there are on the market, the lower demand will be for your specific property.âTo avoid regret, you must take action.âWith this in mind, I told this client that by listing sooner, sheâd almost certainly receive multiple offers and sell her home for far more than her asking price. Unfortunately, she chose to listen to the advice of her friends and family over mine.We put her property on the market in June (per her request) and though we did everything we could to make it look like a model home, her shot at success was hindered by the high level of competition. The same week she listed her home, three other properties went up for sale in her neighborhood.Our clientâs home sat on the market for about 45 days and ultimately sold for $860,000. If she would have followed my advice, Iâm confident we could have sold for close to $900,000.When it comes to buying and selling a home, timing is everything. Itâs important to take the advice of the agent youâve hired, or plan on hiring, as you work toward your real estate goals.

This is to say that if youâve already spoken to a lender, youâre in prime position to buy, and you see a house that ticks off all the boxes, we suggest you jump at the opportunity to buy.As weâre sure youâre aware, rates have recently been characterized by volatility, so passing on an opportunity now might just hurt your affordability at a later date. Homes that are priced congruently with market conditions and show well are all but guaranteed to sell.Now, letâs turn our attention to the seller-oriented side of the market.Firstly, inventory is growing. Late April and early May is always the most active selling season and, as such, you can expect to see a major surge come onto the market. Sellers that wish to stay in front of this market frenzy and receive top dollar with relatively low competition would be well advised to list their home in this two-month window.Weâve found that, at the same time last year, average days on market was at 52 days. Contrast that to our current average: 102 days.âIn a few words, now presents a wonderful opportunity, whatever your real estate goals may be for 2019.âAt 2:44 in the video, you can view a slide that shows the average days on market according to price range at this time for Orange County.As previously mentioned, mortgage rates have been many things of late, but predictable isnât one of them. As a seller, youâll want your home to get snatched up off the market nowâwhile rates are still at historical lows. Sure, you might not time it perfectly, but serious buyers who know what they qualify for will submit an offer on your property if itâs to their liking.Only homes that are competitively priced, show like a model, and have the highest market exposure will sell for top dollar. Every seller wants top dollar, but very few put forth the time and effort to put out a high-quality product.In a few words, now presents a wonderful opportunity, whatever your real estate goals may be for 2019.If youâre thinking about buying or selling a home and you have any specific questions about how to get started, please shoot us an email.

        "content": "When it comes to selling a home, there is one major mistake most people make. What is this mistake? Itâs simple: Most people fail to prepare their homes for the market before they list. Every single seller Iâve spoken to wants to maximize their equity and sell for top dollar, but their actions arenât consistent with their goals. Very rarely do these same sellers follow through by adequately preparing their property.Buyers will offer higher prices when they have an emotional connection to a property, and these emotional connections donât happen by mistake. It takes a well-staged, decluttered, and depersonalized home to capture the attention of potential buyers in our market. They fall in love with the space because they can imagine themselves living in it.If you havenât prepared your home ahead of time, itâs pretty unlikely this will happen.The good news is that preparing a home for the market doesnât mean you have to do a complete rehaul of every single room. All it takes is some strategic adjustments.âThe time it takes to prepare a property is well worth it when you consider the results these preparations will bring.âMaking minor repairs, giving the walls a fresh, neutral coat of paint, and thoroughly cleaning each room will make a massive impact on your success. Each of these things will boost your chance of earning top dollar, while simultaneously ensuring that buyers will have a strong first impression when they step foot in your home.And if you go the extra mile by hiring a professional stager, youâll be in an even better position. Stagers know what it takes to present a home in its best light.Homes that are staged and feel move-in ready also sell more quickly than homes that arenât. So, in short, the time it takes to prepare a property is well worth it when you consider the results these preparations will bring.If you want top dollar, donât make this major mistake.

But your choice of agent isnât the only important decision youâll make during the listing process. Itâs also essential that you realize not all buyers are the same. To get the best deal, you need to choose the best buyer. So are you choosing a winner?It isnât as easy to choose a winning buyer as you might think. On our team, we have a five-step process we follow when examining various offers with our sellers, and weâd like to share that process with you today:1. We have a conversation with the buyerâs agent. When we talk to a given buyerâs agent on behalf of our seller clients, we do so to learn more about whether theyâre the right fit for the listing.2. We obtain an introductory letter. When a buyer or their agent includes a letter to explain their motivations, desires, and goals, this bodes well for the strength of their offer.âTo get the best deal, you need to choose the best buyer.â3. We pull the sales activity of the buyerâs agent. Determining whether a buyer is qualified is important, but assessing the quality and experience of their agent is crucial, as well. If the agent has a very limited track record, for example, this could pose problems later on in the deal.4. We determine if the buyer is pre-approved. Itâs good to have a willing buyer, but itâs even better to have one that is ready and able. A pre-approval letter verifies that the buyer has spoken with a lender and has provided evidence of their ability to move forward with the purchase.5. We ensure that the offer is clean and complete. If an offer is missing details or is poorly presented, we can expect the buyer and their agent to conduct other aspects of the deal with a similar lack of attention.Each of these steps helps my sellers, my team, and me choose winning buyers.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me or my team a call or send us an email.

As a listing agent, my goal is to not only help my sellers get the best price and terms, but also to create a smooth and easy-flowing escrow experience. Of course, occasionally circumstances beyond anyoneâs control will arise, but relisting a property after a deal fell apart in escrow is generally something we want to avoid.Our team knows what itâs like to work on behalf of buyers, which means we also know what our seller clients can feasibly expect from the offers they receive.We include a completed residential purchase agreement with every offer we submit on behalf of our buyer clients, and we expect this same level of due diligence from the buyers who approach us when weâre representing a seller. One of the best ways to avoid having a deal fall through during escrow is to only accept offers from buyers who have proven themselves to be ready, willing, and able. This means they should be fully pre-approved, should be willing to include a completed residential purchase agreement, should be capable of producing proof of funds, and, as a bonus, should be able to explain what this purchase would mean to them.Â âWhen buyers and sellers both give it their all, deals are far more likely to succeed.âWhen we represent buyers, for example, we like to include an introductory letter with each of our offers. This letter explains who the buyer is, what attracted them to the home, and why it would be perfect for them.We go the extra mile in creating a âcomplete packageâ with every offer we submit on behalf of our buyer clients, and so this is the same level of preparation and work we expect to see from potential buyers when we represent sellers. If youâre buying, you need to make sure your agent is submitting a winning offer on your behalf. And if youâre selling, you should expect the offers you receive to be the complete package we described earlier. When buyers and sellers both give it their all, deals are far more likely to succeed.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "When it comes to the market, Iâve got one simple piece of advice: Stop thinking like an investor, especially if you arenât one.Before I explain what I mean by this, Iâd like to first cover a few important points about our current market.1. Demand is down. More homes are available, which means buyers feel less pressure to get out there and make a purchase on a home they may not love.2. Fewer homes are selling. As a result of our increased inventory, sellers are faced with higher competition. Pending and closed sales are down between 30% and 35%, which, obviously, has had a major impact on market conditions in general.3. Homes are taking longer to sell. The homes that are moving off the market are taking 50 to 100 days longer to do so.4. Prices are flattening out. With demand down, prices have dropped in turn. Our shift toward a buyerâs market has become increasingly clear through this and other factors.5. Interest rates are volatile. Nobody has a crystal ball, but all signs indicate that rates will continue rising through the end of this year.With these conditions in mind, letâs circle back to my first point. Buyers and sellers need to adjust their mindset in light of our current circumstances. Thinking like an investor is no longer the right way to navigate the market.âThink about why youâre buying or selling and put that reason first.âBuyers who ask about a homeâs resale value are a prime example of what I mean when I refer to people who are thinking like investors. Rather than thinking about the property theyâre buying in terms of how well it will suit their wants and needs, too many buyers are focusing on what they think they can earn from it down the line.Our team has encountered buyers who, because of this mindset, turned down a home they loved simply because it wouldnât have made a lucrative rental property for them in the future. This would be valid if they were buying it as a rental to begin with, but they werenât. This home was going to be their primary residence. The idea of renting it out was purely speculative.Many sellers, too, have fallen victim to this mindset. They may want to list their home and have many good reasons to do so, but choose to hold onto it instead because they want to wait for a better market. In short, my point is this: Think about why youâre buying or selling and put that reason first. Donât derail your goals because you got caught up thinking like an investor.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If youâve had to take your home off the market after it went without selling, why didnât it sell? Even if you were highly motivated to sell your home, hired an agent, and did everything correctly, it may not have sold for a couple of reasons: price and exposure.Did you price your home too high? What was the pricing strategy you used with your agent? Was there a lot of competition on the market? How is the rest of the market doing in regard to inventory, recent and pending sales, active listings, etc.? These are all things you want to look at when you consider price as a factor in your unsuccessful sale. In the last few years, you could overprice your home and the market would catch up to it. This isnât the case anymoreâprice is crucial when you list your property.âIf buyers arenât excited by the home online or in person, they wonât want to buy it.âExposure is broken up into two parts: marketing and showing. While marketing is done to get the word out to buyers, home showings give these buyers a look at what theyâd be getting, so a showing needs to give a good impression. Do the photos and videos look great? Has the home been well staged? Did a designer come through to spruce up the property? You can do everything to get the word out, but if buyers arenât excited by the home online or in person, they wonât want to buy it at top dollar.To get your home sold successfully next time, your first step is to interview different agents and see what they can do for you. How will they price your home? How will they prepare it to show its best? How will they broadcast it to all the right people? The agent you choose can make the difference between selling your home or going through the entire process again.If you have any questions or would like more information, feel free to reach out to us.

They havenât begun the selling process on their home, they havenât spoken to a lender yet, and they have no idea what theyâre qualified for. So, when they say theyâre âready to go,â theyâre anything but.I expect this to happen with the average buyer, but there are professional agents doing this! Theyâll show our listing, weâll call to get feedback, and theyâll tell us their buyer is interested but isnât in a position to submit an offerâthey havenât spoken to a lender yet.âThereâs a lot a buyer needs to do before theyâre truly ready to go.âThe way I was taught was to work with ready, willing, and motivated buyers who know what they want, have spoken to a lender, know what they qualify for, and are in a position to submit an offer. This market is unpredictable, so great homes are sold fast. If one buyer falls in love with a home, itâs very likely that another buyer has the same feelings.Thereâs a lot a buyer needs to account for before theyâre truly ready to go. My advice for preparing? Connect with a lender, connect with a good real estate agent, and understand your options. What we say on our team is that just because weâre meeting, it doesnât mean you have to buy. If you meet with us and our lender, youâre meeting first and foremost to learn.

In our meeting, we talked about home preparation, pre-marketing and marketing, the negotiation period, closing, and the transition into their new home.âThe last thing you want to do is be rushing around to get your home listed.âOne thing we took into consideration is that there are several wildcardsâthe days in escrow can vary greatly, and price range and market conditions can also make a huge difference in a home sale.

        "content": "If youâre a homebuyer, now is your chance to take advantage of our market.Depending on which area you live in our marketplace, inventory is up anywhere from 25% to 40%. Not only that, but homes are also taking a lot longer to sellâsometimes 40 or 50 days longer than they did earlier in the year. This means you have more homes to choose from and more time to make sure youâre making the best decision possible. On top of everything else, fewer homes are selling, which means thereâs less demand.Another important factor you need to be aware of is rising interest rates. Iâve been talking about this for the past few months, but interest rates hit a seven-year high recently and theyâre predicted to continue climbing. For every 1% that rates climb, buyersâ purchasing power decreases by 10%.Despite all this, a lot of my clients are still saying, âRobert, if the market is flattening and prices are dropping, why not just wait a little bit and get a home for a better deal down the road?âIf rates rise by another 1% and homes values drop by 5% (which is a very likely scenario), youâll actually be spending more money per month for a home that, on paper, youâll seemingly be getting for a better deal.Â âIâm here to tell you that doing nothing is a really bad idea.âTo be clear, Iâm not saying every potential homebuyer should buy right now. Iâm simply saying that if you can afford to buy and you actually want to buy, you should consider doing so right now. During the last six years, a lot of buyers I worked with wished they had more time to make a decision and that they werenât getting caught up in bidding wars as soon as they found a property they liked. Well, now theyâve got their wish.However, since our market is changing, itâs also creating doubt. That doubt is creating fear, and thatâs causing buyer paralysis. Since theyâre not sure where the market is going, theyâre thinking they might be better off taking a step back and seeing how everything plays out. Iâm here to tell you that doing nothing is a really bad idea.Lastly, keep in mind that just because you meet with a Realtor (or at least someone on our team) it doesnât necessarily mean youâre buying. When we meet with a buyer and determine their needs, we may decide that theyâre ready to buy now, but we also might decide theyâre better off waiting a year. Thatâs why, if youâre considering buying, the best advice I can give you is to get in touch with a local Realtor. If you call us up, weâd love to talk more about your goals and see what your options are.If you have any other questions about our Orange County market or youâre thinking about selling a home, feel free to reach out to us as well.

Iâve been talking about this shift for the last few months and now it is finally here.Hereâs what weâre seeing right now. Home inventory is up, demand for properties is down, interest rates are rising, fewer homes are selling, and homes are taking longer to sell. In fact, 40% of the homes that are listed on the market right now will be canceled or expire. This is why timing is so essential when selling. Every day, every week, and every month that you wait to list, youâre risking a lower net profit on the sale of your property.Now that weâve talked about timing, letâs discuss strategy. In the last six-and-a-half years when the market was aggressively appreciating, you could use the wrong strategy and still sell your home. Even if the photos online werenât great or the home didnât show great, it didnât really matter. Inventory was so low that buyers would buy anything. If your home was overpriced to start, the market would eventually catch up.âThe market is very unforgiving right now.âThatâs not happening anymore. The market is very unforgiving right now, which is why I want to talk about three things that could negatively affect you if you use the wrong home-selling strategy:1. Your home is going to take much longer to sell than normal, if it even sells at all.2. You could be potentially leaving tens of thousands of dollars on the table by overpricing from the start and reducing your price over time.3. Your home will ultimately sell for less money.If you are considering selling your home in todayâs market, I recommend that you interview at least two to three agents and really understand what each of them will do for you. You should choose the one who is going to put together the best strategy for you to sell your property in a reasonable amount of time for the maximum price.If you have any questions for me or would like to know what our team can do to help your home sell quickly and for top dollar with minimal hassle, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Every single seller I know wants to earn top dollar, but very few sellers are willing to do what it takes to put out a product thatâs worthy of that goal.This disconnect is one of the main reasons a property might sit on the market. To avoid this, thereâs one simple rule sellers must follow: Presentation is everything.Your property shouldnât look âlived inâ when a buyer comes by for a showing. Instead, it should look like a model home. Anything less will make it very hard for you to generate the kinds of offers you want or any offers at all.Every single room should be neat, well staged, and have a clear purpose. If you have a four-bedroom home youâre looking to sell, then you need to present it as just that: a four-bedroom home. That means if one of these bedrooms is currently acting as a storage closet while youâre preparing for your move, then itâs time to clear it out. Donât show your home at anything less than its full potential.âIt doesnât matter how much (or how little) youâre selling your listing for; you need to showcase your home in its best light.âI recently toured a property that had an amazing loft. It wouldâve been a perfect space for a living room or game room, but instead of utilizing it in an appealing way, the seller had filled it with boxes. This is a perfect example how the quality of a listing can be dragged down by a lack of presentation.It doesnât matter how much (or how little) youâre selling your listing for; you need to showcase your home in its best light. A low price doesnât mean you can get away with offering low quality. The person buying your home is likely scraping together everything theyâve got. Therefore, youâve got to do your part to make the experience worth their timeâand their money.To earn top dollar for your home, whatever that may be, you and your agent will need to develop a âvisionâ for your property.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Buyers have been complaining for six years now about how difficult it is to find a house. What they might not realize is that this lack of supply has largely been a result of the interest rates we were seeing during that time.Now that rates have begun to steadily creep up, though, itâs no longer a matter of buyers being unable to find a homeâinstead, buyers are simply choosing not to look. Despite the fact that inventory has risen and overall conditions have leveled out, many buyers are letting a fear of the unknown prevent them from taking advantage of these favorable conditions.Â âIf youâre on the fence about purchasing a property, yourself, now is the time to get in touch with a lender and become educated on your options.âInstead of focusing on list price alone, buyers must start considering where affordability is headed. Interest rates are still historically low, so locking in a rate today is a far better choice than waiting things out and hoping for the best in the future.The last thing my team and I want is for a buyer to miss the opportunity to secure a home at a rate that works for their budget. If you wait too long to buy, you may have a much harder time affording a home at all.We recently worked with a client who told our team that if they had put off their move any longer, they wouldâve been unable to make it happen at all. These buyers went under contract a month ago, and if they wouldâve waited until today to do so, their payment wouldâve been an extra $181 per month.So if youâre on the fence about purchasing a property, yourself, now is the time to get in touch with a lender and become educated on your options.And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

Waiting until the new year may traditionally earn you more money, but weâre currently in an appreciating market where the inverse may be true.Â âListing during the holidays gives sellers the perfect chance to make their home stand out.âIâve written in the past on this subject before, when I compiled a list of the top nine reasons to list during the holidays, and Iâd like to return to this topic today. If youâd like a copy of my past article on the subject, Iâd be happy to send one to you, but for now Iâll be sharing just three main points:1. Buyers are more motivated during the holidays. It may be true that fewer buyers are on the market during this time of year, but the ones who are out and looking will be much more driven. After all, people choosing to spend their holidays searching for a new home are obviously doing so for a good reason.2. Thereâs less competition. Along with there being fewer buyers on the market over the holidays, there are also fewer listings. This gives you the perfect chance to make your home stand out.3. Inventory dramatically rises after the holidays. All of the sellers who waited until after the holidays to list will be flooding the market at the beginning of the new year. Listing before this happens, therefore, is a surefire way to capture the interest of motivated buyers while competition is low.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "Is now a good time for you to sell? There are four factors to consider when asking that question.The first is your mindset. This has been one of the most challenging aspects of our market shift. When I say âmarket shift,â I mean weâve been in an aggressive sellerâs market for the past six years, but weâve reached the peak of the market and now weâre transitioning into more of a normalized market. With this, sellers are struggling with the idea that their home wonât attract multiple offers and sell for $10,000, $20,000, or $30,000 more than the last sale. Theyâre also getting frustrated that their homes are taking longer to sell.All of this is to say that you need to have the appropriate mindset and appropriate expectations when selling, and you need to figure out what the market is like in your area.The next factor to consider is inventory, which has generally increased. In some areas, it has spiked by as much as 40%. Whatâs the demand like in your area, though? Do buyers have a lot of choices or fewer choices? Supply and demand is a basic economic principleâthe more of something there is, the less itâs worth. If you live in an area where your home is the only property for sale, you might be able to be a bit more aggressive with your sale, especially if you live in a very attractive area. If you live in an area that features several other listings, though, youâll need to price your home accordingly or youâll have a tough time selling it.âWho you work with is crucial in getting your home sold for the best price.âThe third factor to consider is interest rates. Interest rates matter to sellers just as much as they do to buyers. You canât sell your home unless you sell it to a buyer, and most of the time, a buyer canât buy your home unless they get a loan, and whatâs associated with that loan is the interest rate. A homeâs price is a one-time fee; what really matters is the interest rate. As rates go up, buyers can afford less, and the buyer pool for your home gets smaller and smaller.Finally, consider pending sales, or how many homes are selling per month. Across the county, pending sales are down 25%. Not only are fewer homes selling, but in many cases, theyâre taking longer to sell.So, is it a good time for you to sell? Maybe it is and maybe it isnât. Now that you have this information, your next step should be to talk to a local Realtor. Iâd be happy to share my expertise with you, give you a free consultation, and come up with a detailed plan of attack if you decide that selling is in your best interest.Selling a home requires two things: price and exposure. You have to make sure buyers in your area are attracted to the price you set and that the agent youâre working with exposes your home to all the buyers who are out and about. Like I said, the market is shifting, so who you work with is crucial in getting your home sold for the best price.As always, if you have any other questions about our market, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "For the past six years, we went through an aggressive sellerâs market, and prices appreciated significantly during that time. Now, though, the market is stabilizing, and thatâs good news for buyers.If youâre thinking of buying a home, there are four points you need to remember when it comes to the state of our current market.First, inventory is rising. In some areas, itâs increased by as much as 40%, which means you have more options to choose from. As inventory rises, demand falls. Youâll have more time to look at properties, more time to make a decision, and you wonât be competing against as many other buyers either.Second, interest rates are slowly rising. Whatâs important to understand when taking out a mortgage loan to buy a home is that the homeâs price is a one-time purchase, and what youâre actually buying is the interest rate. If youâd rather wait until next year to buy a home because the market is stabilizing and you think youâll get a better price then, you may very well be able to do so. However, if rates jump from 5% to 5.5% in that time, youâll end up spending more money per month for a home you bought for less. This is why itâs so important to talk to a lender during the home buying process so you can better understand how interest rates affect you.âThere are more homes available, theyâre taking longer to sell, and better deals are out there.âThird, pending sale activity, or how many homes are selling in a monthly basis, is down 20% to 25%. Since inventory is rising, this means homes are taking longer to sell and fewer of them are selling. Again, this drop in demand means youâll have longer to make a decision and a better chance of getting a good deal.Lastly, think of your mindset. A lot of buyers out there are suffering from a sort of paralysis because theyâre uncertain of whatâs happening in the market. The previous five years, though, buyers were complaining about how there was no inventory, and how every time they found a beautiful home, there were 10 other buyers who wanted it too. Well, now theyâve got their wishâthere are more homes available, theyâre taking longer to sell, and better deals are out there.In other words, look at this as an opportunity. Is it a good time to buy for everybody? Probably, not, but if you are thinking about buying, get in touch with a lender and a Realtor and analyze your situation, because you can potentially buy a great property at a great price while still securing a low interest rate.As always, if you have any other questions about our market, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

While a large portion of todayâs buyers are afraid to pull the trigger, those who have professional guidance are sure to find and secure a fair deal.Â âEducated and well-prepared buyers who are working with the right agent will find that success is well within reach in todayâs market.âThe old adage is true: Knowledge is power. Buyers today must understand what they can qualify for, what kind of monthly payment theyâre comfortable with, and whatâs motivating them to buy in the first place.Thankfully, the recent changes in our market actually pose a great benefit to buyers. Weâre now seeing higher levels of inventory, with fewer multiple offer situations as a result. Beyond that, homes are also spending longer on the market. This gives buyers more time to think through their purchase before making a move.Nevertheless, itâs still important for buyers to be prepared to pull the trigger when the time is right. Educated and well-prepared buyers who are working with the right agent will find that success is well within reach in todayâs market.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If youâre thinking of listing your home, realize that the initial price you set for it will be one of the most important factors in selling quickly and for top dollar.Any agent you work with should place a high level of emphasis on this aspect of your selling strategy. Having someone by your side who is able to examine market trends and predict where conditions are heading will be crucial to your success. And this mindset applies to more than just real estate. Take the words of famed hockey player Wayne Gretzky, who once said: âSkate to where the puck is going, not where it has been.âThe point of this quote is to realize that in hockey, life, and real estate alike, the secret to success is to stay one step ahead.As the market shifts and becomes more normalized, this proactive mindset is exactly what sellers must apply to their listing strategy. Donât chase the market.Â âIf you price correctly from the start, you will be far more likely to sell quickly and earn top dollar.âIf the going rate in your neighborhood for homes like yours is somewhere between $700,000 and $720,000, the last thing you want to do is price your home at $740,000 to leave room for negotiation. This may have worked in the recent past, but our market has changed.As inventory increases and homes begin taking longer to sell, some of the pressure buyers previously felt is being relieved. Now, instead of buyers chasing properties, sellers are chasing buyers. And there have been a lot more price reductions lately as a result.To avoid this fate for your own listing, you need to take the direction of our market into account when developing your pricing strategy. If you price correctly from the start, you will be far more likely to sell quickly and earn top dollar.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Itâs not always a great time to buy for everyone depending on their situation. Before you make the decision to buy for yourself, itâs a good idea to speak with an agent and/or a lender to get an idea about what you can afford and why you want to buy.Â However, with the market shifting, a lot of people are capable of buying, but are uncertain about whether now is the right time or if they should continue to wait. Here are five reason why itâs a great time to buy for many buyers right now:1. We have a lot more new inventory. In the last six years, home prices have been going up because of our low inventory. Buyers have been looking at properties and making offers, but are continually getting outbid. After six long years, we are seeing more homes hit the market and buyers have plenty of options.âBuyers have more options to choose from these days.â2. Rates are still historically low. If youâre a younger buyer who isnât used to seeing high interest rates, you probably think our current rates are pretty high. However, if you take a look back a few decades and see what we were dealing with at that time, a 5% interest rate is a steal.3. You can get on with your life. If youâve always thought about buying but are stuck in a rental property situation, you owe it to yourself to figure it out. Talk to a lender or a Realtor to see if you can qualify. Itâs always free to talk.Â 4. You can create more certainty for yourself. There is a lot more certainty involved with owning a home. When youâre renting a property, youâre at the mercy of the landlord. When you own your own home, you make all the decisions.5. Pride of ownership. My dad once told me, âWhen you own a home, life just changes. It becomes better.â Itâs hard to explain, but itâs certainly true. Itâs an indescribable feeling.If you have any questions for me or youâre thinking about buying any time soon, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

However, if you have been on the fence about listing your home on the market, here are five reasons why now is a fantastic time to sell:1. You can still sell your home for top dollar. The market is still in its early stages of transition from a sellerâs market to a normalized market. That hasnât happened quite yet, however, and you can still get your home sold for top dollar.2. There are still plenty of motivated buyers. These buyers are eager and excited to buy now because of the increased inventory on market. Buyers are eager and hopeful to find a home right now.âMotivated buyers are coming to this market in bunches.â3. Motivated buyers are eager to secure lower interest rates. If youâve been following the market, you know that interest rates are predicted to rise soon. Savvy buyers understand that when these rates rise, it will increase their cost of homeownership. Those buyers want to secure an interest rate now by buying a home in this market.4. You can upgrade to a new home for a lower price. If youâre looking to sell your current home and buy something bigger and better, you can still sell for top dollar, then enter a home buying market with great rates, more inventory, and potentially lower prices.5. You can get on with your life. If youâre thinking about making a move, you should seriously talk to an agent about what your options are. Whether you want to move to find a better space, better school district, or a new area for a better quality of life: You only live once, so reach out to someone like myself today to see if thatâs a possibility for you.If you have any questions for me or youâre interested in selling your home anytime in the near future, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

The term âinstant offerâ refers to a scenario in which a company buys a sellerâs home outright so that the seller can avoid the listing process.These days, instant offers are becoming much more mainstream. But is this approach to selling worth it?In an instant offer scenario, the company purchasing the home will close as quickly or slowly as the seller wants, and also help them transition into their next home. This sounds incredible, right?After all, who wants to go through all the hard work of preparing a home, finding an agent, arranging showings, hosting open houses, haggling with negotiations, and everything else that goes into a traditional listing process?Â âWhile instant offers may be less of a hassle, they wonât earn you top dollar.âHowever, as convenient as an instant offer may seem, itâs important to consider the more subtle aspects to this approachâbecause while instant offers may be less of a hassle, they wonât earn you top dollar. These companies are not in the business of holding real estate.They want to buy your property for much less than itâs potentially worth in order to sell it for a profit later, all while making the seller feel as if theyâre being done a huge favor.By all means, pursue an instant offer sale if this arrangement fits well with your goalsâbut do your research. Find out what fees theyâre charging and what price you might earn, and then speak to an experienced agent about the results you might see from a traditional listing process. You may find that the work involved with a conventional selling experience is worth it, after all.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

If a seller comes to us and wants to sell for $900,000 but market conditions donât support that figure, I will guide them toward a more feasible price.Of course I want my clients to earn the best deal possible; however, unlike certain sycophantic agents, I know that succeeding in this market will require a more pragmatic approach.

Well, if youâve been following my videos, youâll know that Iâve brought up market shifts a number of times. With our own clients, weâve noticed that with all the things going on in the market, there is an uncertainty about the future of the market that is causing a sort of paralysis. Is the market going up or down? Is it stabilizing? Is it a bad time to buy or sell? A lot of people have just stopped dead in their tracks and are wondering what they should do.Knowledge is the key to curing that paralysis.Interest rates and home prices have gone up, homes are taking longer to sell, and the demand for property is dropping. So what can you do to keep yourself from being paralyzed in the market? Here are some tips:âKnowledge is the key to curing market paralysis.â1. Stay educated. Work with a local professional who will help you understand whatâs going on in your micro market. Every single market is different from the next, and the same is true of individual price points and clients. Just because itâs a great time to buy or sell for one person doesnât necessarily mean that itâs a great time to buy or sell for someone else.2. Work with a knowledgeable agent. Now more than ever, itâs critical to work with a real estate agent who understands the area and the market youâre looking to buy in.3. Talk to a great lender. Your agent should also know where to find a great lender who will help you understand what you qualify for, whether youâre a first-time homebuyer or a move-up buyer.When youâre uncertain about a decision, youâre probably always going to say no to it. Thatâs why learning more about why youâre looking to make a move or why youâre looking to buy a home is going to help you gain the knowledge and power to make the best decisions for you and your family.If you have any questions, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "If you are thinking about putting your home on the market or have already tried multiple times and couldnât get it sold, I want to explain why you shouldnât rush into hiring your next agent.Once your home is taken off the marketâwhether itâs withdrawn, expired, or canceledâyouâll be inundated with dozens of calls from agents within the first couple days asking to schedule an appointment with you to explain what they will do differently to get your home sold.The reality is 95% of those agents donât have the skillset or the experience to get the job done. In fact, a lot of new agents get their start by calling expired or withdrawn listings because they have no other source of business. Itâs an easy and cheap way to fill their pipeline with clients.As you are getting bombarded with these calls, I recommend that you talk to a few of these agents and pick a few to interview. During the interview process, there are three things you need to keep in mind.First, the market is changing. For the last five or six years, we have seen a huge uptick in prices and been in a strong sellerâs market. Agents have been able to overprice properties and still get them sold. Now, though, you need to be hyper-aware of your local market in order to price your home properly. You need to know how many homes have sold, what they sold for, what their condition is, what the current level of inventory looks like, what your competition looks like, etc. Youâll need a great agent to help you come up with the right price.Second, your strategy has to change. You canât just change agents and expect different results. You also need to dramatically change your homeâs price or the way you market it.âYour next agent should be someone whose marketing and negotiating expertise will be able to net you more money from your home sale.âThird, do your due diligence. Donât hire someone just because they give you a good feeling on the inside. You want to work with someone you feel like you could get to know, trust, and like, but donât just make your decision based on that. And, donât just base your decision on how much an agent charges. There are a lot of agents out there who will âbuyâ a listing by offering the seller a discount on their commission. The best agents never discount their commission. Theyâll be able to net you more money from your home sale because their marketing and negotiating expertise is so strong.As part of your due diligence, ask each agent the following questions:  Why should I hire you?  What are you going to do to sell my property?  What homes have you sold in my area?  How will you market my home to expose it to all the different buyers in my area?  How are you going to be able to justify the commission you charge?  How will I be able to walk away with more money by working with you instead of a discount broker?Make sure you pick the right agent to sell your home. As our market changes, your home selling strategy needs to change, and you need to hire someone with experience.If you are thinking of putting your home back on the market, I would love the opportunity to meet with you and talk about what my team and I can do to get your home sold. Of course, if you have any other questions about our market or any other real estate needs, feel free to call or email me anytime. Iâd love to help you.",

In fact, last month I made my first price reduction on a home in six years.Because the market is shifting, you need to shift your mindset along with it. If youâve listed your home and it has sat on the market for two or three weeks without an offer, it is time to consider a price reduction. I want to help you make the right price adjustment so that when you do, your home sells right away. What you donât want to do is chase the market down, which is what a lot of sellers are doing.Â For example, if you list your home at $950,000 and it doesnât sell after three or four weeks, donât drop the price down to just $949,000. A $1,000 price reduction in a million-dollar price range wonât inspire any buyers to say âWow! Now I have got to see this home. Thatâs the price Iâve been looking for.ââWhen you list your property, listen to the market and get what feedback you can from the buyers and their agents.âInstead, you should reduce your homeâs price by 3% to 5%, depending on how much activity it has already generated. If you price your home at $989,000 and it has only gotten a few showings after two or three weeks, youâre better off dropping the price down into the neighborhood of $949,000.A price reduction should be enough to inspire buyers and ensure that you still squeeze as much money as possible out of your sale. If you do it correctly, you should be able to attract multiple offers for your home and sell it for more than the price you originally reduced it to.If you are getting ready to put your home on the market or would like to know what your home is worth, please feel free to reach give me a call or send me an email.

Prices have been rising steadily for the past several years, interest rates are creeping up, and all the news about how great our market is has many homeowners convinced that now may be the perfect time to sell for top dollar.This has caused a huge influx of homes to hit the market. As a result, homes are taking longer to sell. As homes take longer to sell and buyers have more options, demand for any specific property tends to fall for a couple reasons.Â âIf you are a buyer, now is a great time to get the home you want at a great price.âFirst, when there is more of something, itâs worthlessâthis is simple supply and demand. Second, people tend to struggle with making a choice when there are too many options. Homes arenât worth as much right now because there are more of them, buyers are paralyzed by all the choices they have, and homes are taking longer to sell. When homes take longer to sell, sellers get frustrated and reduce their prices.You need to be ready for these price reductions because now is a great opportunity to get the home you want at a great price.

Specifically, I would like to look at interest rates, inventory, and price reductions.If you have been following my recent videos and blogs, then you know that I have been talking about a shift in the market for about a year now. When I talk about this shift, I mean that the market may stabilize and home prices may even dip. This may occur in mid to late 2019.For the last six years, we have been in a really strong sellerâs market, and buyers have been struggling to find properties. When they do find properties to submit an offer on, they end up getting outbid because of multiple offers. Meanwhile, appraisers struggle to justify agreed-upon home prices because of increased values.All of that, though, is coming to an end and we are going to start seeing the shift take over. For this reason, I want to talk more about price reductions.Interest rates have been rising consistently for about a year now while home prices have been increasing for about the last six years. Inventory is now also growing because sellers are seeing an opportunity to sell their property. With the influx of inventory, buyers now have more options. This lowers the demand for property and increases how long homes spend on the market, because buyers are not making quick decisions.âA couple weeks ago, I did my first price reduction after six years and it resulted in a quick sale for one of the properties on market for a couple months.âSince homes are taking longer to sell, they are selling for slightly less than what they are potentially worth in todayâs market. A couple weeks ago I did my first price reduction after six years and it resulted in a quick sale for one of the properties on the market for a couple months. I reduced the price on a couple listings and now they are starting to see a lot of activity.Whether you are a buyer or seller, we are going to start seeing a lot more price reductions. It is going to take some time for buyers, sellers, and agents to be comfortable with this change because it has been so long. The people who notice this change are going to win because they will change their strategies.If you are a buyer, stay on top of interest rates and make sure you know what is going on long-term. If you are a seller and you are not getting the activity you want, you may need to adjust the price. Meanwhile, if you are considering listing your home on the market, you will need to consider what you are going to list your home at. No matter what, now more than ever you are going to want to consult with a great Realtor to understand your next best step.If you have any additional questions or are interested in buying or selling, please feel free to contact me.

As soon as their property is withdrawn from the market, agents start swooping in and offering their help. This can be overwhelming, and the entire experience tends to leave sellers feeling uncertain.The first thing sellers should realize is that expired, canceled, and withdrawn listings are fairly uncommon at the moment. Our market has been very strong for the past six years, but this doesnât guarantee that every listing will succeed. Buyers still want to strike a deal they can feel good about.Â âOur market has been very strong for the past six years, but this doesnât guarantee that every listing will succeed.âAnd especially now that the market is shifting, weâre about to see a lot more homes failing to sell. If this has happened to you, and you are still motivated to put your home back on the market, there are a couple of things you must realize before relisting.1. There has to be a dramatic change in your strategy. You canât just put your home back on the market using the same techniques as before and expect different results. A dramatic change, whether itâs in price, in how the property is presented, or in the agent you work with, must occur.2. Recognize that the market is shifting. Demand is down, rates are up, and buyers have more options than in the past. The best advice I can give you is to connect with two or three new agents and discuss what approach will be necessary to list successfully during this shift. You should also think about how quickly you will relist. The sooner youâre able to do so, the better. Waiting too long could cost you thousands.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or would like to schedule a no-cost, no-obligation consultation about your real estate goals, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If you are a buyer, you have likely heard about the changes taking place in our market. Perhaps you have thought to yourself, âIf a shift is coming and weâre at the marketâs peak, maybe I should wait for a better price.âThis all makes sense, but only if you are planning to purchase a home using cash. And this is not the case for the average buyer today. Most buyers right now are purchasing homes using a mortgage.With that in mind, the thing you have to realize is that when you pay outright, the price of buying that home is a one-time expense. Mortgage payments, on the other hand, will hit your wallet every month. Waiting for a better price if you plan to purchase with a mortgage could actually make it more expensive to buy, since interest rates are on the rise.If interest rates rise just 1%, then property values would have to fall 10% for you to have the same monthly payment. Given the fact that (at least) a 1% Â rise in interest rates is more likely than a 10% drop in property values, waiting to buy may not equate to the savings many would hope.Â âThe best advice I can give buyers is to meet with a lender and discuss what you can afford, and what is motivating your desire to purchase a home in the first place.âBuying a home for less but paying a higher monthly price for a mortgage does not make sense. The best advice I can give buyers is to meet with a lender and discuss what you can afford, and what is motivating your desire to purchase a home in the first place.To put these current circumstances into context, it is important to realize that the market makes shifts every six to seven years. 2008 was one of the worst markets I, and many other people, have ever seen. Yet when the market shifted between 2012 and 2013, things improved. And we are now on schedule for another shift to occur. If historic precedent remains true, our market will likely continue on a six-year cycle of stabilizing, correcting, dipping, and then rising back up again.Â So, per this cycle, we can expect our market to remain strong for the next six to 12 months, and then we will likely see a dip. But, after that, it will come back up.After selling real estate for 12 years, I can tell you that market conditions do not impact everyone equally. This is why it is so important for those of you who are considering buying to connect with a lender and start discussing your options.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Where is our Orange County market headed?If youâre a seller watching this video, this is probably a question thatâs been on your mind. Buyers and sellers alike have been pretty spoiled by market conditions in the past six-and-a-half years or so. Interest rates have been at historic lows, and home prices have been going up consistently, having risen 50% in the last five years.Yet these trends are not sustainable. For the last year or so, Iâve been hearing a lot of agents and mentors of mine talking about the market shifting, but this week was the first time I experienced what they were referencing firsthand.I was recently working with a couple of sellers and had high expectations for their listings. We priced the properties aggressively, staged them, and did everything we needed to do to earn top dollar. Nevertheless, we didnât see the outcome we were hoping for. In fact, two days ago I reduced the price of one of my sellerâs listings. This is the first time Iâve done that in six years.We are going to sell the property, but it will ultimately be for less than we had assumed we could earn. And thatâs because the market shift is happening now.Â âIf you are seller, now is the best time to connect with an agent and discuss your options.âThis shift is actually affecting those in higher price points more than those in the $300,000 to $500,000 range. Whenever a shift occurs in the higher price points, it tends to only be a matter of months before the middle and lower price ranges begin to also see that same change.The bottom line is this: If you are seller, now is the best time to connect with an agent and discuss your options. A lot of buyers are picky with what theyâre spending money on. Prices are up, interest rates are up, and inventory is up. This gives buyers more choices, which lowers demand and breeds indecision. A broader range of homes to choose from can paralyze buyers, which contributes to more price reductions, higher days on market, and properties selling for lower-than-expected prices.With that all said, I want to reiterate that sellers should act now before these conditions solidify.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or are curious about how I can assist you with meeting your real estate goals, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Today I would like to look at how the market is and if you are ready to ride the wave. Of course, when I ask if you are ready to ride the wave, I am not talking about surfing in the oceanâIâm asking if you are ready to stay in your home for the next two to four years.Recently I have been making a lot of calls to my past clients, current clients, friends, and family to update them on what is going on in the market. There are three key indicators I have been looking at:  Days on market. The average time it takes to sell is going up.  Inventory. The number of homes available for sale is going up.  Interest rates. Much like the other two indicators, interest rates are rising and buyers are concerned that they will not be able to buy a home.We have been following these indicators for the last four or five weeks and have noticed now that we are seeing signs of a shift coming soon. However, this does not mean that the market is not great and that if you list your home this week, you will not get multiple offers.Let me explain. Usually we see a shift happen in the higher price points first. To know the higher price point of a certain area, you need to know what that areaâs average price point is first.âIf you are not prepared to stay, you should know that your home may not be worth as much in the next year.âLetâs say you are looking to sell in Irvine and the average price point is $850,000. Those homes are still selling quickly depending on how they look and how they are priced. Homes that are priced lower are selling even quicker. That is a very aggressive market.Homes in Irvine that are priced between $1.5 million and $4 million, however, are taking a lot longer to sell. In this area, weâre starting to see those three indicators I mentioned above.Over time, that trend will trickle down into the average and lower price points until everything is taking a little longer to sell, or maybe not sell for the best price.This is when we will see the market shift from the strong sellerâs market that we have had for the past seven years to potentially a flat market or a buyerâs market.Right now is one of the best selling seasons weâve ever experienced. In six to nine months though, this shift will start to affect average home prices. If you are not prepared to stay in your home for the next two to four years, you should know that your home may not be worth as much in the next year. You will have to sit and stay in your home until the market balances and starts going back up.To decide if now is the right time for you to sell, think about your current situation and ask yourself if you can wait. If you think you are ready, please feel free to reach out to me and give me a call or send me an email. I would love to help you in any way that I can.",

        "content": "You may have tried to sell your home in the past and were ultimately unsuccessful. Maybe the listing agreement expired with your agent, or you got frustrated and canceled it.I talk to a lot of people who have been through a situation like this, and I get a lot of different feedback. However, lately Iâve been hearing from homeowners that they are going to take their home off the market, make some upgrades, and relist it.When somebody tells me that, I ask this question in response: âWhen you relist the home, are you going to relist it at a higher price so you can recover those funds?â The answer is always yes.Â However, this is a big concern for me. In my experience, upgrades can certainly add value to a property, but if you upgrade just prior to listing your home, youâre probably not going to get back what you put in. If you spend $50,000 on upgrades, youâll be lucky to get $45,000 back.Â âRepositioning your home wonât break the bank.âThe process might take longer than expected, and you might end up listing your home in a market thatâs not as strong, or maybe the buyer will hate your upgrades-Iâve seen a lot of things go wrong before.If you tried to sell your home and were unsuccessful, l recommend that you shift your focus from upgrading the property to repositioning it to get the right buyer and the right price. Repositioning your home means preparing your property to sell for the highest and best price without breaking the bank. Maybe you need to repaint, put in new carpet, or stage the home because itâs vacant.If youâre in a situation like this, hold off on the upgrades for now. Spend some time, money, and effort on repositioning the home instead. My team and I specialize in this method. We want to attract the right buyer at the right time for the highest and best price without spending money that we know we wonât recover.If you have any questions for me in the meantime or you or someone you know could use our help, give us a call or send us an email today.

I remember back in 2015 when I was talking to a potential homebuyer who felt that he was going to be paying too much for his property. At the time, he was hesitant but still decided to pull the trigger.These days, he is very grateful that he bought at that point because the home is worth 15% more now than it was when he bought it. He may have paid a premium for the property, but heâs already made that back and then some. Instead of paying rent for those three years, heâs been able to invest in his own mortgage and see the appreciation for himself. Three years later, the situation is similar in our market.Â âWeâd be happy to connect you with a lender who can assist you.âYou might pay a premium for a home now, but youâll find that itâs a great deal in a few years.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Should you wait on our current market?Before I answer that question, I will summarize our market by focusing on three key factors: interest rates, home prices, and inventory.If you have been following the market, you know that interest rates have been creeping up slowly month over month. If you are a buyer, every time rates go up it decreases your buying power. For instance, if you are looking to buy a $750,000 home and interest rates rise just an eighth of a point, you will no longer be able to afford that home. If you are a seller, every rise in interest rates reduces the number of buyers looking for your specific property.Home prices are rising as well. Again, if you are a buyer, this means you will only be able to afford less as time goes on. As a seller, this is great news for your home saleâs potential. If you are looking to move up to a larger property after you sell, however, the price of that home is only going to increase too.Â âIf it makes financial sense for you to buy or sell now, go for it.âInventory is something our marketâs been struggling with. Buyers love more inventory, but there arenât a lot of homes to choose from. May, June, and July constitute our highest selling season, though, and this stretch is also the best time to buy a property, so you should see more homes coming onto the market. If you are a seller, this isnât exactly good news. It means you will have more competitionÂ So to answer the question of whether you should wait or not, it dependsâas I have said many times beforeâon your situation.To me, real estate is math. If you are a seller and you want to sell and buy, you want to calculate how much your home will sell for and how much that sale will allow you to afford for your next purchase. If you are a buyer, you need to talk to a lender before you do anything else so you know what you can afford. After that, dig deep and ask yourself why you are making the move to begin with.After you look at the big picture and it makes sense financially for you to buy or sell, then I say go for it. We know what is going on right now, but we canât predict the future. Prices may fall 12 months down the road, but interest rates may rise a full 1% during that time as well, which means you would pay more per month for a house you actually got for less. Â As always, whether you are buying or selling, nothing replaces a great real estate agent. If you are already working with an agent, talk to them about these things. If you donât have an agent, please feel free to give us a call so we can talk about how we can help you achieve your real estate goals.If you have any other questions about our market or you have any other real estate needs, please reach out to me as well.

        "content": "Today, I want to pose an important question: What is your timeline?My marketing team and I have been conducting some research recently, and weâve found that there are three primary stages in the real estate timeline that buyers tend to follow as they prepare to make a home purchase. Letâs take a look at each of these stages.1. Â Awareness. Weâve found that people in this stage tend to be between 18 to 24 years old. This is the stage where a person may have considered the notion of buying a home but havenât really gotten serious about doing so. People often become very comfortable with where theyâre at in life. Sometimes, they become too comfortable. In order to move past the awareness stage, you must be proactive.2. Â Interest. Buyers at this stage in their home purchase timeline have become more actively engaged with their home search. They are beginning to look more frequently at online listings, and they may be consuming other media related to the real estate process as a means of preparation. At this point, buyers are typically eight to 12 months away from actually moving forward with a home purchase.3. Â Decision. This final stage in the real estate timeline is the point when buyers are calling Realtors and setting up appointments. Buyers in the decision stage are typically three to six months out from making their home purchase. It is at this stage that people become truly serious about finding a property.âA home purchase is a major decisionâit takes time.âWith all that in mind, remember that a home purchase is a major decisionâit takes time. Most of the clients my team and I work with spend several months working their way through the process.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Let me ask you something: Are you leaving money on the table?Allow me to explain what I mean. For sellers, consider whether youâre truly getting the most out of your listing. On the buyersâ side of things, think about whether the price youâre paying for a home is fair.Iâve seen a lot of homes sell for more than they should, lately. However, Iâve also seen homes sell for far less than they could have. One reason for this is Realtor mismanagement.Now, I would like to share some information about the processes of buying and selling a home. Hopefully this insight will help to put everything into perspective for you.Â âThe true challenge is finding an agent who will guide you every step of the way.âThere are three parts to each of these processes, and Iâd like to go over each of these steps within both processes for you today. Letâs start with the three steps of buying a home:  Find the right home.  Negotiate the contract.  Think about what comes next.As for sellers, the three steps of listing are:  Find the right buyer.  Negotiate the contract.  Think about what comes next.You probably noticed that each of these processes, on a basic level, are very similar. Another similarity between these processes is the importance of having a strong Realtor by your side. However, many people in todayâs hot market wonder whether itâs worth spending the extra money on one Realtor when another might do the job for half the cost.Helping someone find a home is easy. And, in a hot market, itâs also easy to help someone find a buyer. If you put a home on the market, list it online, and price it fairly, youâre going to get offers. The true challenge is finding an agent who will guide you every step of the way. The right agent will not only help you to buy or sell a home, they will also help you put (or keep) more money in your pocket at the end of the transaction. If youâre buying a home, you need to work with an agent who can negotiate the best price.All of these are the considerations you must keep in mind when choosing an agent. Find an agent to work with who you know, like, and trust. Beyond that, find someone who will help you maximize your success. The right agent will keep you informed and continue to provide you with value even after your transaction is complete. Are you looking for an agent who is truly there to help, or are you looking for one who will disappear after closing? The choice is yours.If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to know how my team or I could help you reach your real estate goals, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "category": "",
        "content": "How is our spring 2018 real estate market doing right now? Historically, this is the time of year when more homes start selling than in previous months. Typically, inventory begins to grow through this time as well.Â If youâve been following the market, whether youâre a buyer, seller, investor, or curious homeowner, youâve probably heard about our recent low inventory levels. Actually, weâre in an inventory crisis right now. To give you an example, there are only 70 active listings available in Tustin right now.Â This leaves buyers with very few options. In fact, buyers in Tustin may only be able to find two to three homes that meet their search criteria right now. This is because when inventory is low, the demand for property rises. This also causes prices to go up over time. Currently, weâre expecting prices to continue rising for between 12 to 18 months.Of course, we canât really predict what will happen after that point. When people ask me, âHowâs the market?â This is difficult to answer for a couple of reasons:Â 1. Every area in Orange County is different. We call these various areas âmicro markets.â These can be broken down to specific cities, specific areas in a city, or even specific neighborhoods.2. Every person is different. It is difficult to tell people how the market is because the answer will change depending on their wants and needs.Â There are so many different factors that go into the current market condition that itâs almost impossible to give people a clear answer. But, as Iâve said before, inventory is low and demand is high.Â âSomeone looking for a home in Irvine will have a much different experience than someone searching in Newport Beach.âToday, though, Iâd like to go over a few statistics in particular.Â In the city of Irvine, which is where I live and where my team runs its business, we have 361 homes available for sale. The number of pending homes is 292, which means thereâs currently about 1.3 months of inventory available in Irvine.Â This figure is called the absorption rate. It essentially means that if no new homes came on the market, it would take 1.3 months for all current inventory to sell.Â As I mentioned earlier, Tustin has just 70 homes available. On top of that, 75 homes already went under contract in Tustin this month. This means the city has less than one month of available inventory.Â In contrast, there are 300 homes available for sale in Newport Beach and only 100 are currently under contract, meaning Newport Beach currently has three months of inventory.Â Someone looking for a home in Irvine will have a much different experience than someone searching in Newport Beach. This just goes to show why itâs so difficult to answer people who ask how the market is doing.Â If you have any other questions, would like more information, or want to have a discussion about the market in relation to your specific needs, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If youâre a home seller, one of the most important things you can know is that what a home is worth and what a buyer might be willing to pay for it are two different things.Â If youâve tried to sell your home in the past but failed, you know this all too well. I talk to several homeowners a day whoâs listings have either expired or been canceled, and most of the time I ask them if theyâd consider putting their home back on the market if I can get them the price they want.Their usual answer goes something like âRobert, thank you very much, but I already know what my home is worth.â My response? What your home is worth isnât always what you can sell it for.Â Let me give you an example of what Iâm talking about.Â The weekend before last, I met with a client of mine in the Tustin area who wanted to sell their home. I did the research going into this meeting and knew what comparable homes in the area had been selling for. When I crunched the numbers for him and factored in all the important details (what was going on in the area, the condition of the property, the time of year, the current inventory, and how the home actually showed), my opinion was that the home was worth anywhere from $720,000 to $725,000.Â However, what I think a home is worth doesnât matter. What matters is what it can sell for. After I gave this client my estimate of their homeâs value, I told them what was most important to them was what a buyer is willing to pay for it. Thatâs when I started talking about my marketing strategy and how I planned to prepare the home for sale.âWhat matters is what your home can sell for.âIf youâre paying attention to our market, you know that inventory is historically low and there arenât a lot of options for buyers. In other words, itâs a hot sellerâs market. Technically, you could put a home on the market and sell it really quickly.Â Would you be leaving money on the table, though? When people hire my team and me to sell their home, we make sure they get maximum value for their property. We donât want them to leave any money on the table.Â After I told my client that their home was worth anywhere from $720,000 to $725,000 on paper, I told them that if they had faith in my team and me to list their home, we could sell it for anywhere between $740,000 and $760,000. Thatâs when I got their attention. They knew I meant business.Â If youâre considering putting your home back on the market and youâre curious how we prepare homes for sale and market them so they sell for the most money possible, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to speak with you.",

        "content": "In my 12 years of selling real estate, Iâve come to learn that every buyer wants two things. One is something they know about, but the other is something they donât. Â The first thing every buyer wants is a great deal. Weâre in a hot market, so any home that looks great will sell. How can you squeeze out as much money as possible from the buyers who are looking, though? Thatâs easyâyou have to maximize your homeâs exposure. When every buyer in your area looks for homes online before actually seeing them in person, you need to make sure that when they see your property, it makes them want to check it out immediately.Â A lot of times, when I talk to sellers, theyâll say something like âRobert, what if we price our home aggressively and price it low and we only get one offer?â If you do the research up front, you know what your home is worth on paper, and you price it aggressively, youâll more than likely attract multiple offers.Â When you price your home as a great deal, buyers will naturally want to see it because theyâre looking for a great deal. The best part of this strategy is the paradigm shift that happens to the buyer the minute they walk into your property and fall in love with it. Not only will you get multiple offers, but the sale price will exceed the list price.âBuyers want a great deal for your home and to be able to feel emotionally connected to it.âHowever, none of that matters unless you also offer the thing that buyers donât know they wantâsomething that makes them feel good. Most buyers donât search for homes to find something that makes them feel good. Instead, they usually have a more logical mindset thatâs focused on bedroom counts, bathroom counts, square footage, etc. In my experience though, buyers will pay more for a home if it gives them the right emotional connection.Â To make an emotional connection with buyers, you need to take time to prepare your property for sale. If a buyer is going to spend as much as $1 million on a home, theyâre going to want to move into something that makes them feel good. This means you might have to spend money to make some minor repairs or upgrades.Â Most importantly, though, never overlook the option of home staging. Whether you live in the property or not, you should strongly consider hiring a designer who will put together a complete package so that the buyer instantaneously feels emotionally connected.Â If you have any questions or youâre thinking about selling a property and you want to learn more about how my team and I help your clients sell for top dollar, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "title": "Whatâs the Best Way to Combat Buyer Fatigue?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre a homebuyer in the Orange County area, Iâm sure at some point youâve felt whatâs known as âbuyer fatigue.âÂ In a nutshell, buyer fatigue happens when buyers try so hard to buy a home, but for some reason they continuously miss out on opportunities. Over time, these buyers can get stressed out and question whether they should even be looking for a home.Â If youâre currently suffering from buyer fatigue, I have some advice that will help you get through it. There is so much opportunity in our current marketplace. Both homes prices and interest rates are expected to continue to rise for the next 12 to 18 months, if not longer, so the sooner you buy a property, the better the deal youâll likely getâespecially if youâre buying a home to actually live in it.Â In the Irvine area, there are 345 active listings. You might think thatâs a lot of properties for sale, but if you consider how large of an area Irvine is, all the different types of properties available here, the unique characteristics of those properties, the different price ranges involved, and each buyerâs specific tastes, you find that buyers themselves only have three to five realistic buying options.Â If youâve been watching the news, reading the newspaper, or browsing social media lately and youâve heard about low inventory, thatâs what theyâre really talking about. Weâre finding that every one of our buyers is lucky to find three to five homes available in their price range that fit their needs.Â If you consider that the average price point in the Irvine area is roughly $700,000 and above, many buyers we work with want to see more than just three to five homes. Unfortunately, though, thereâs just not a lot out there. We have had clients find a home they love, submit an offer for it, and win that home, but thatâs not very common. Most other buyers are waiting patiently and eagerly for new inventory to come on the market. As we know, once new inventory comes on the market, everybody gets excited about it.Â To put things into perspective, there are more buyers out looking for homes than there are homes available. If a property comes on the market and itâs priced right and shows well, it will likely attract multiple offers. We even listed a property recently that got 24 offers.âYou might not get the first property you submit an offer for in our market.âSo picture this: If there are, for example, 10 offers on a property, that means nine buyers are going to miss out on it. Some may be missing out for the first time; some may be missing out for the fourth, fifth, or sixth time. Those buyers have to then wait for another property. If they donât get the next one, they have to wait again. And again. And again.Â A lot of these buyers arenât seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Theyâve done everything they need to do, but theyâre still not getting the properties they want.Â The best advice I can give you as a homebuyer is to focus on why you want to buy a certain home. There are a couple other things you need to understand going into the home buying process. First, you will be paying a premium for any property because inventory is so low. Second, you might not get the first property you submit an offer forâit might have to be the fourth, fifth, or sixth.Every time Iâve worked with a client who previously missed out on three or four homes and then finally got an offer accepted, they tell me theyâre glad those three or four other homes didnât work out because they finally found the home they love.Â If you or anyone you know is looking for a home in our market or you have any other questions or real estate needs, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to speak with you.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Iâm sure youâve heard the term âsupply and demand,â but how does that affect buyers and sellers as we approach the spring and summer selling season here in Orange County?In a nutshell, supply and demand means the less of something there is, the more valuable it becomes. Letâs say youâre dealing with wine. When a new wine is released, thereâs a lot of it, but as the vintage gets older and older, thereâs less of it to go around. Once you get down to the last case, it becomes extremely expensive.If youâve been following this video blog, you know that inventory usually drops in November as we approach the holiday season and stays low through early February. Generally, it will start rising after Super Bowl Sunday, rise again in March, continue to grow in April, and then significantly rise in May and June. June, of course, is the summer selling season and the time everyone assumes is the best opportunity to sell a house. The reality is, this is actually the best time to buy a house because there are more homes on the market.If youâre a seller, you want to sell when thereâs not a lot of competition. If you live on a block with five other homes for sale, buyers will leverage those homes and yours against each other when they make an offer. If your house is the only one on that block for sale, however, itâs worth potentially more to buyers because itâs their only option.I talk to a lot of people who tell me theyâre interested in selling but want to wait until spring or summer, and this always raises some concerns with me. If thereâs a specific reason they need to wait, then perhaps thereâs no way around that. If theyâre just planning on listing in the spring or summer because they think thatâs a better time to sell though, then thatâs an incorrect strategy.If youâre just waiting for the spring or summer market to come before you list your home, you may want to talk with a Realtor and understand whatâs happening in your micro-market. Every pocket in Orange County has different trends, so you donât want to wait to sell only to find out that there are three or four other properties listed right alongside yours. That will devalue your property. List when there is low inventory and less competition so thereâs more demand for your property and a greater chance to sell for top dollar.Â âWe should see inventory increase over the next few months.âIf youâre a buyer and youâd rather wait until April, May, or June when inventory has grown to make your move, thereâs nothing wrong with that approach. I do encourage you, though, to stay on top of whatâs happening with interest rates. If you have a preferred lender you like working with and have already been pre-approved through, they should be sending you weekly updates on interest rates. Why? If interest rates go up too high, even if you get a smoking-hot deal on a property, you still might end up paying more money per month for it.Â Overall, we should see inventory increase over the next few months. As more properties come on the market, buyers will have more options, and sellers will have less demand for their properties.Â Another scenario weâve been dealing with lately is clients wanting to sell their current home and buy something bigger or smaller. If you intend to do the same thing, meet with a Realtor now so you can sell before inventory grows and buy when you have more options. The savvier sellers we work with usually list their homes in February, March, or early April so they can catch the market before it gets too active.Â If you have any more questions about how supply and demand will impact our market in the coming months or youâre thinking of buying, selling, or investing in real estate, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to help you. Until then, happy selling!",

These days, consumers are able to search for homes, get automated values, obtain pre-foreclosures, and much moreâall by going online.Â However, real estate websites are not always accurate. If youâre a buyer out there, itâs important to realize that while the information you see on these websites is syndicated from the multiple listing service, things can slip through the cracks. Â I have buyers call me all the time to tell me about a property they found online, only for me to look into the listing myself and find that it has been off the market for months.Â Given todayâs low inventory, a day or two is all it takes for buyers to lose out on a property theyâre interested in.

        "content": "Are you going to wait until the springtime to list your home?If youâve been following my video blog, youâve seen all my latest market updates. Iâve talked about both selling during the holidays and selling during the springtime.Â Spring is a very active time to sell. From now until then, home prices will probably rise a little bit, so youâve got that on your side. One thing a lot of people donât consider, though, is that listing inventory will dramatically rise in February and March. There are a few reasons why. One of which is a lot of people are convinced that springtime is the absolute best time to sell. No matter what anybody tells them, theyâll put their home on the market in February, March, or April.Â Many sellersâcontrary to my beliefâthink itâs a bad time to list their home because nobody is really looking for homes. In reality, a lot of homes sell during this time for amazing prices. When the new year comes, we see a huge influx of homes pop up on the market. If thereâs a significant rise in inventory, the demand for your specific home will be lower. When buyers have more choices, they have more leverage.Â So, while springtime is a very active time to sell a home, youâll have a lot more competition and your home may be overshadowed by all the other homes on the market in your area. The reason I bring this up is because youâre either considering selling your home or youâve tried to sell in the past and were unsuccessful.Â âFocus on what your needs are first.âIf you know me, you know that I call a lot of homeowners who were unsuccessful selling their home in the past. Many of them say theyâre not interested in selling their home until February, March, or April because theyâve heard thatâs the best time to list.Â I tell them the same thing Iâm telling you todayâif youâre looking to sell your home for top dollar, itâs usually best to sell when inventory is low and demand is high.Â Keep in mind, though, everyoneâs situation is unique, and itâs impossible to time the market perfectly. Thatâs why you want to focus on what your needs are first. If you canât sell until March or April, then you canât sell until March or April. If you have some flexibility, though, you might want to consider my advice. It could help you come away with an extra $10,000, $15,000, or even $50,000.Â If you have any questions or youâre considering putting your home back on the market in the very near future or next spring and youâre wondering what itâs worth, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Why is it important that we meet sooner rather than later? The answer is different for buyers and sellers.Â My team and I meet with clients on a daily basis, and we oftentimes learn that if we wouldâve been able to meet with them sooner, the process wouldâve been more efficient, the plan wouldâve been more rock-solid, and we wouldâve been able to help them achieve their goals more efficiently.Â This isnât to say that we donât do those things when we meet with clients, but when you donât have a lot of time to put a plan together and execute that plan, you have to compress a lot of things into a small window, and that can get stressful.Â For example, I met with a buyer about four months ago who told me they werenât interested in buying a home until December or January and that theyâd rather meet then. I told them it was better to meet sooner than later and suggested we meet in October and put a plan together so that when they were ready to go, Iâd be ready to go too. The buyer was adamant on meeting in December, though.Â When we met in December, we were both on the same page, but because they were looking to buy a property, their first step had to be to get a pre-approval. When they pulled their credit, they discovered they had three small liens on their credit report that were very old. We now have to spend two or three months cleaning up that buyerâs credit so they can get a high enough credit score to qualify for a loan with a great interest rate. Their goal was to be in a new home by January, but now theyâll have to wait until March, April, or May.Â âReach out to a Realtor sooner rather than later so you understand what youâre getting into.âI experience the same situation with sellersâIâll speak to them in September or October and theyâll tell me they donât want to sell until January. A lot of them assume that when they want to sell their home, all they have to do is meet with a Realtor, put a sign in front of the house, put a lockbox on it, and list it online.Â What they donât realize is every home sells for a different price depending on the agent selling it and what you do to prepare that property for the marketâwhether thatâs staging, painting, decluttering, taking professional photos, etc. Thereâs so much that goes into the backend of preparing a home for sale that sometimes the process can take three, four, five, or even six weeks.Â I went into one of these sellersâ homes last week and noticed there was a lot of furniture in there. I knew if I were to show that home as it was, I wouldâve sold it for $10,000 or $15,000 less than what the market value was. If we spent some time decluttering the property, repainting it, making some minor repairs, staging it, and getting professional photos done, that would all take two, three, or four weeks. The seller, therefore, is no longer in a position to sell in Januaryâtheyâll have to sell in early-to-mid February.Whether youâre thinking about buying or sellingâwhether thatâs in one month or one yearâyouâre better off meeting with an agent soon to understand what your options are. If your home is ready to sell or your credit is flawless, thatâs great, but thatâs doesnât happen all the time. A lot of people donât know what it takes to buy or sell a home, so reach out to a Realtor sooner rather than later so you can understand what youâre getting into.Â If you have any questions about the importance of meeting with an agent sooner rather than later or you need help buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "Are you getting in the way of your Realtor?What I mean is, do you trust the person you hired? If you trust somebody you hiredâand you should trust the Realtor you hireâyouâll stand back and let them do the work, right? At the end of the day, if youâre going to do all the work, you shouldâve just listed your home on your own. But because you know youâll get a better price by listing with a Realtor or you know you donât have the time to do all the work, youâll hire a professional to get the job done.Â In my experience, when my clients stand back and let me do what I know I should do, they always win. When I work with clients to try and micromanage me and stand over my shoulder, I tend to do not as well as I would like to, and ultimately that affects them.Â A lot of our business (about 68%) comes by way of past client referrals, so many people we work with already know somebody whoâs worked with us. Thereâs already a certain level of trust built in there because their mom, son, coworker, etc., referred us.Â We also get many clients via the internet, and when we meet these people for the first time, weâre absolute strangers. How can you trust someone youâve never even met?If you get referred to a Realtor and youâre considering working with them, make sure you interview them. A lot of people just meet one Realtor and say, âHey, you seem like a nice personâletâs do thisâ without having any expectations or strategies set in place. When clients feel like their expectations arenât being met, they tend to micromanage the process.Â âInterview multiple agents before hiring one.âThe reason itâs valuable to interview different agents is so you can understand what different agents can do for you. Every agent is differentâthey each have a different personality, experience level, track record, and network. Meeting with multiple agents and understanding what your options are will help you find someone you can trust.Â Letâs say you had a handyman come into your house and you told them to do 10 or 15 different things and youâre standing over their shoulder saying, âWhat about this? What about that?â In my experience, you always get what you expect. If you expect the handyman to miss something, theyâll probably miss something. If youâre over their shoulder micromanaging them, it will probably distract them and make them more likely to miss something.Itâs the same relationship dynamic with your Realtor; itâs a very high-trust position. I work with a lot of different clientsâsome of them let me do my thing, and others tend to micromanage because they havenât let themselves be vulnerable to my advice.Â If I work with someone who says, âRobert, we hired you for a reason. You go and do what you have to do to get us what we need,â those clients will win. The clients who micromanage me and tend to get in my way will affect their own bottom line.Â If you have any questions about interviewing Realtors so you can hire someone you trust or youâd like my help in buying or selling a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Until then, happy selling!",

        "content": "Before we start on todayâs topic, I want to emphasize something that I talk about with my own clients: Itâs very hard to time the market perfectly. The best strategy is to do what works for you in your specific situation. If you need to sell your home by early next year, then thatâs what you need to do, instead of trying to perfectly time that decision with the market.For those who have some flexibility or want to know whatâs going on, I want to shed some light on the market.Itâs still a very strong sellerâs market, the inventory of homes is still very low, and homes are still selling pretty quickly. In fact, I put a home on the market in November, and within six days, we got 12 offers, and the home sold for $25,000 above asking price. The interesting fact is that it sold for $21,000 higher than the most recent sale in that neighborhood. Some of that may have been timing, our marketing strategy, our pricing strategy, and other factors that we put a lot time and effort into, but the bottom line is that the activity we saw was unusual, and thatâs a theme weâre seeing.For sellers, itâs important to know that inventory is usually very low during the holidays, so if youâre listing your home, youâll have a lot less competition. The buyers during this time are also more motivated, so you may see buyers submitting higher offers on your particular property.However, you donât want to list your home too close to the holidays, when many people, regardless of motivation, are going to be exiting the market. Listing your home anytime after the weekend of December 9 or 10 is probably the latest you want to go unless you have a serious need to sell. Itâs also important to know that if youâre planning on listing your home in the new year, generally inventory will rise starting in mid-February, so youâve still got some time to take advantage of that low inventory market.I sometimes get a little bit of pushback from sellers who want to list in mid to late January so they can enjoy their holidays. The reason why Iâd rather meet with someone sooner than later is that sometimes it takes time to prepare a home for sale. The best-case scenario is one or two weeks, and the worst is four, five, or six weeks, depending on what needs to be done. If youâre thinking of selling during that time period, itâs a good idea to meet with a Realtor earlier so you have time to prepare your home for maximum sale price. In my experience, we actually spend more time preparing the home than the home is on the market.âThereâs no one-size-fits-all strategy.âFor buyers, again, your plan needs to make sense for your situation. Figure out why it is youâre moving and what makes the most sense to achieve that end. Thereâs no one-size-fits-all strategy.I can say this: inventory will grow in the new year. However, prices will probably rise by then as well. Itâs kind of a give-and-take situationâyouâll have more options as a buyer, but prices and interest rates may go up.If you or anyone you know is looking to buy or sell a property in the Orange County area or if youâre just looking to pick our brains about what makes the most sense moving forward, always feel free to reach out to me or my team. Also, if you have any video ideas youâd like to see me talk about in the future, please send them my way.Â Until then, happy selling!",

        "title": "What&apos;s the Goal of a Home Inspection?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre getting ready to buy a property, youâre probably wondering what you can do to make sure the home is as good as it seems. A home is a costly investment, so the last thing anyone wants is to spend a lot of money only to encounter some unpleasant surprises.This is what makes home inspections so valuable. Today, I want to break the subject of home inspections down into two parts.Â First, what kind of home inspections should you get? Usually, we recommend that our clients start with a general home inspection. We can certainly recommend a company to our clients, though some clients may already have an inspector in mind. Either way, a general home inspection will provide a basic overview of a homeâs condition.Â If the home inspector doesnât find any significant issues, many people will feel comfortable proceeding without further inspections. But if the inspector does find something wrong, they may recommend that you contact a specialized professional, such as a plumber or roofer, to take a more in-depth look at the problem.Â At that point, the next step may be to have a specialty inspection performed. But remember, each inspection you have will be an additional cost. Ideally, you should strike a balance between feeling comfortable with the home and not spending too much money on frivolous or unnecessary inspections.Â Every situation and every home is different. Therefore, there is no one answer as to which inspections will be necessary.Â âYou should strike a balance between feeling comfortable with the home and not spending too much money.âThe second area Iâd like to focus on in regards to home inspections is what to do if you discover a problem.Â Homes in California are sold as-is. What you see is what you get. This is why home inspections are so valuable. Something we want to help our clients understand, though, is that older homes wonât come in perfect condition. We arenât going to ask the seller to clean the carpets, repaint, or change out a mirror thatâs losing silvering.Â When a home inspection is performed, cosmetic issues and upgrades arenât the focus. If a home was up to code at the time it was built, the seller doesnât need to make updates that would make it current. If you buy an older home, you should expect to pay some of your own money making these upgrades.Â Home inspections are meant to detect issues that are more serious, such as those that cause safety concerns. If you work with our team, we can help you review the inspection. Weâll then negotiate on your behalf to try to see what we can get the seller to fix or give you a credit for. However, the seller can say no to any request, even those that are safety issues.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "content": "Today, Iâd like to share three different pricing strategies you can use when preparing to list your home for sale.Itâs important to know that thereâs no one-size-fits-all solution in real estate. So, when we meet with our clients, we always offer them these three strategies. I could go into a lot more detail on each of these strategies, but Iâll keep it short and sweet for now.Â The first strategy is pricing your home high and leaving room to negotiate. This is the strategy we see most often. While this strategy will sometimes work in a hot sellerâs market, it can be ineffective if you price it too high. The higher you price a home, the less activity youâll get. Why? Because every single buyer out there wants a great deal.Â âThereâs no one-size-fits-all solution in real estate.âThe second strategy is to price your home within market value. If youâre working with a Realtor, theyâll bring you the data from your neighborhood and give you a range of nearby properties. Pricing your home within that range will show buyers that youâre motivated to sell. This will increase the number of people who see your home, and this increases your chance of multiple offers.Â The third strategy is one of my favorites, which is the auction strategy. For this strategy, we price your home slightly below market value. When you list your home even just a little beneath what homes in your neighborhood are going for, youâre announcing to buyers that you are ready and willing to offer them a great deal.Â The intention of this deal is to draw in multiple offers, which will then generate a higher price. Using this strategy, youâll often end up selling above fair market value because of the competition you created within your listing.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "What Should Buyers and Sellers Do as We Approach the Holiday Market?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What can a buyer or seller expect from our market as we approach the holiday season?Â Weâve had a lot of clients asking us lately whether they should buy or sell now or wait until the new year. I want to share a few pros and cons from each scenario and tell you what I would advise one of my clients to do.Â If youâre a seller thinking you want to sell now, there are a couple things to keep in mind.Â First, a lot of the buyers who arenât motivated to buy during the holiday season will exit the market. That said, the buyers who stick around and continue to look for homes have many reasons for sticking around, and they want to buy before the end of the year. These buyers that stick around are motivated. Although you may deal with fewer buyers looking at your property, the ones who are looking will be submitting stronger offers.Â Second, just like a lot of unmotivated buyers are leaving the market, a lot of unmotivated sellers are leaving the market too. This means youâll have a lot less competition, which will increase the demand for your property and the odds you can sell for a great price.Â If youâre a seller thinking you want to wait until the new year to sell, we can only speculate as to whether prices will be higher in the new year, but the way things are going in our market, prices are still going up, so you might get a higher price by waiting. However, everybody else who decided to wait until the new year to sell their home will be listing at the same time you do, which means youâll face a lot more competition and the demand for your home will be lowered.Â As you can see, there really is no ârightâ or âwrong.â It all boils down to what makes the most sense for you. Now, letâs shift the focus to buyers.Â âThere really is no ârightâ or âwrongâ time to buy or sell.âIf youâre thinking of buying now, youâll have less competition due to the exodus of unmotivated buyers. However, you will also have fewer options to choose from as far as homes go because of the exodus of unmotivated sellers. The homes that will still be on the market, though, will have motivated sellers behind them, so you may be able to sneak in and get one of those properties for a better price.Â If youâre thinking of buying in the new year, youâll face more competition from buyers re-entering the market, which might lead to multiple offer situations. However, youâll also have more homes to choose from because more sellers will be entering the market as well. If the market continues to go up, prices may be higher.Â Whether youâre a buyer or seller and you want to act now or wait until the new year, itâs important to know that itâs almost impossible to time the market perfectly. The best advice I can give to you or any of my clients is this: You need to figure out what makes sense for you. Look at your situation and understand why youâre selling or why youâre buying and put together a strategy with your agent.Â If you have any more questions about whether now is the time for you to buy or sell a home or you have any other questions about our Orange County market, donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd be glad to help you. Until then, happy selling!",

        "content": "Do you even want a Realtor?The reality is that if youâre looking to buy a property, you have two options: you can try to take care of everything on your own and interact with the listing agent without representation, or you can do some research and choose a buyerâs agent whoâs right for you.Â Either way, youâre going to be working with a Realtor. Why not work with one whose job is to represent you? 99% of homes that sell are sold through Realtors, and thereâs a reason for that.Although, what Iâve learned throughout my years of experience is that if buyers could work without agents, they probably would. Most consumers donât really want to deal with it. Some may not think that thereâs such a thing as a good Realtor.Today, I want to change your mind and let you know that there are so many good Realtors out there. Buying a home is a big decision with a lot of emotional and financial commitments involved. Trying to undergo the process alone simply isnât the best route to take. After all, the job of an agent is to make things easier for you.When choosing a Realtor, remember that you should always work with someone who can help navigate you through the process. The right Realtor will have a great relationship with lenders, as well.Â âBuying a home is a team effort.âIf youâre looking to buy a home, why not work with someone who has your best interests in mind instead of defaulting to the listing agent? A buyerâs agent will help you put together a strategy and walk you through the whole transaction. Every step should be made simple and clear with the help of a quality professional.Â The alternative is spending a lot of time and effort calling around to different agents, not making any decisions, and ultimately making things a lot more complicated. If you do that, youâll have 20 different agents all calling and asking if youâre ready to work with them. Why put yourself through the trouble?If youâre just calling different agents throughout the process without committing to a single Realtor, you donât have the benefit of working with someone who knows and understands you and your needs. Bouncing from agent to agent means never having the opinion of someone who has seen every step of your transaction.Â Also, when you work with the listing agent you need to realize that they were hired by the seller to get the most money for the property possible. That being the case, they arenât looking out for your needs.Â A lot has changed in the market and itâs always important to have an advocate on your side who you know and trust. Buying a home is a team effort. Without a Realtor the process will be overwhelming and inefficient.Before choosing a Realtor, meet with a few professionals to determine who would be the best for you.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "If youâre a seller, Iâd like you to know and understand that a home is worth whatever a buyer is willing to pay for it. Yes the market statistics, data, and trends are important, but at the end of the day, the buyerâs willingness to pay is key.To help illustrate this point, Iâve got a short story to share with you.Â Recently I was looking at a condo in the Irvine area with a client. This property was priced at $630,000. As soon as my client saw this property, they absolutely fell in love with it.As it happens, their daughter actually lived in the same neighborhood. Since they were older and had retired, being near family was as important to them as how much they loved the property.âTo my clients, the money wasnât as important as the home itself.âTo them, money wasnât as important as both of these factors. When we ran the numbers, we learned that homes in this neighborhood were selling between $620,000 and $630,000. Even so, the client told me they wanted to offer $640,000.I knew this number was higher than what would likely be justified by an appraiser, but they didnât really care. They had the additional funds to cover the difference and didnât want to take any chances.The property actually did see a number of other offers, but the sellers didnât disclose how much they were for. For all we know, our offer might have been the highest. Because of the level of interest in the property, my clients wanted to do everything they possibly could to make sure they won out against the other buyers.When the sellers sent back their counteroffer, my clients revised their original offer and said they would be willing to pay $642,000. Thankfully, they did get the property.But as I expected, the property did appraise for slightly less. Still, my clients didnât have an issue paying the difference. To my clients, the money wasnât as important as the home itself.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Today weâre going to talk about the conditions of our current market. More specifically, I want to consider the question, âHow is the price?âIâve talked in the past about the market shifting, but I want to bring that subject up again today.Â Since I started talking about shifting, Iâve been getting a lot of phone calls saying, âHey Robert, when you say shifting, what do you mean? Are the prices going down? Should I wait six months before I buy? Will I get a better deal?âI want to clarify that a little bit: When I say shifting, I mean that weâre starting to see the market stabilize.Â In the early part of this year, the market was very aggressive. Homes were selling for more than what they were worth and there were many multiple-offer situations. This was primarily due to the low interest rates and the fact that we had very low inventory.In early 2017, you could get away with pricing a home above market value and probably still sell it. As the market continued to appreciate, it would continue to catch up to the overpriced listing, and then the home would eventually sell.From what I can see now, itâs a little bit different.Inventory is growingânot significantlyâbut it is growing over time. The market is slowing down a bit, but only because summer is over, and people are geared more towards school and work. The holidays do tend to see a slower market, as many buyers and sellers exit the market.âWhen I say shifting, what I mean is that weâre starting to see the market stabilize.âSo what Iâm seeing right now is that, if a home is priced right and it shows well, it will sell very quickly and for a great price. You might even see multiple offers on a property like this because, even though inventory is growing, the inventory on homes that are priced correctly is shrinking.The reason I bring this up is that a lot of people might call and say, âRobert, youâre saying that the marketâs shifting, but Iâm still seeing multiple offers every time I bid on a property.âThe answer to that question is that youâre putting offers on homes that are priced right and that show well. So when I talk about the shift, Iâm really talking more about those optimistic homeowners or agents who price their homes 5% Â to 10% above market value. People price this way because theyâre so used to what weâve experienced in the beginning part of the year that they havenât adapted to our current marketplace.When a home isnât priced to sell, itâs going to sit on the market and get stale. In an aggressive sellerâs market, homes are selling within one to two weeks, maybe even a couple days. If a home has been sitting on the market for 30, 40, or 50 days because it was overpriced to begin with, many buyers think, âIf the market is so aggressive, why has the home not sold yet? Whatâs wrong with it?âThose buyers will actually submit offers lower than market value, and sometimes theyâre able to get it. In fact, in the last three months, Â weâve helped clients buy two properties below what we felt was market value. The seller just started way too high, and weâre not in the same market as earlier this year.So if youâre a seller, what should you want to do?Well, you should interview different agents and come to understand three things that will get a home sold for the maximum amount: price, marketing, and exposure. Your agent, if you choose a great one, is going to handle all of the marketing and all of the exposure.Â So when I say interview agents, you want to understand their personality, strategy, track record, and most importantly, what theyâre going to do to market your property and maximize exposure.Next, you want to collaborate with your agent to come up with a price that makes sense, otherwise itâs likely the home will stagnate on the market. Be sure to look at things like current inventory, your competition, the current market in your micro-community, or maybe the overall market in Orange Countyâ you want to understand the different factors and trends, and pick the price that will inspire the most activity around your home.Now if youâre a buyer, what does all this mean to you? The good news is that you donât have to rush and be as aggressive as you did earlier in the year, because inventory has grown. But itâs important for you to understand that if you come across a great home thatâs priced to sell, you still might come across a lot of competition, and you could possibly be outbid.Â Thatâs why Iâm telling you this today. The market is still very strong for sellers. Thatâs what I mean by shiftâyou canât get away with now that which you could have in the beginning of the year.If you found value in this information, please leave a comment or a question.

        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâve attempted to sell your home in the past but didnât find successâwhatâs your next step?Â In this situation, I typically see homeowners do one of four things. Today, Iâd like to discuss each one of these routes and what they achieve.Â 1. Relist their home with the same agent. Every situation is unique. However, by looking at certain statistics and market averages to how a listing performed, you can generally discern how your listing differed from the norm. For example, the average amount of time a home spends on the market in Orange County is just over two months. If your agent was unable to sell your home with a four, five, or even six-month contractâthis does not bode well for you. My team and I, for example, typically sell our homes in just under 28 days. If your agent wasnât able to sell your home the first time, they arenât likely to be able to do so on their next try.Â 2. List their home as For Sale By Owner. While although 2% of homes on the market do sell this way, the remaining 98% of homes are sold through a Realtor. Typically when a homeowner chooses to list this way, they do so because they believe it will save them money. However, listing your home without the assistance of an agent actually involves a lot of unexpected work and costs that people often forget to consider. For example, in order to bring buyers to your listing, you may have to pay a buyerâs agent to do so for you. Additionally, the average FSBO listing will sell for 11% to 17% less than if it was listed with an agent. Instead of focusing on what you are paying in the process, it is much more important to consider the money you will walk away with at the end of the transaction.3. Give up. Life doesnât always work out in the way weâd like it to. As difficult as it is, the key to getting back on your feet after a failed listing is by not letting your emotions drive your decisions. Instead, think back to why you were selling your home in the first place. No matter the reason, it likely still important to you even after your home failed to sell. Just because you were unsuccessful doesnât mean your home is impossible to sell.4. Interview different agents. In my opinion, this is the best option. Speaking to different agents about their strategies, networks, and pricing options can give you a better idea of what is possible for your home. Not all agents are created equal, and selling a home isnât easy. Finding the agent who will be best-suited to take on your listing will make a massive difference in your success.Â If youâd like to know what my team or I can do for you, have any other questions, or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "As Iâve mentioned in the past, predicting what the market may do in the future is an extremely difficult thing to do. However, while it is hard to pinpoint where the market is exactly going, there are certain trends that Iâve noticed from my experience working with buyers and sellers.Since the beginning of 2017, weâve seen a very strong sellerâs market. Homes have moved quickly, prices have been high, and competition among buyers is intense.Â This has caused some homebuyers to take a step backward from the market because they think they can, and should, wait for a market shiftâwhich they believe is coming soon.Â The advice I like to give to my clients, however, pertains to what is happening right now, instead of what may happen in the future. Nevertheless, I have noticed small factors in the market that have started to change my perspective regarding where things are headed.Â âCertain pockets of our market are indeed slowing down.âRecently, for example, my team and I sold three homes to three of our buyers for slightly below market value.Â The reason this came as a slight surprise to me is that each of these homes were staged, marketed, and priced in such a way that they should have absolutely flown off the market. Instead, these homes were on the market for 27, 32, and 50 days.Right now, itâs hard to say whether or not we are experiencing a shift. What I can say is that certain pockets of our market are indeed slowing down. Â If you are a seller, now could be a good time to meet with a Realtor. My team and I would be happy to consult with you about our thoughts on your home and its value. If you wait too long to list, you may be leaving some money on the table.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "Over the course of my career, Iâve met a lot of buyers whoâve wanted to wait before getting pre-approved.Some people want to wait because they are afraid to commit to a Realtor or lender, while others hesitate because theyâre nervous about having their credit pulled. There are also those who simply feel intimidated by the fact that a pre-approval makes the prospect of a transaction seem a little more âreal.âÂ Having nerves before purchasing a home is common and absolutely normal. I, myself, have become desensitized to the process through years of experience. Iâve helped so many people buy homes that my perspective on the ordeal is a lot different from that of a buyer.Â However, thatâs exactly the benefit of working with a professional. Professional agents have the knowledge and experience to navigate a transaction based on what will get results. Getting pre-approved can give buyers a lot of peace of mind.Knowing what loan youâll be using, how much you can afford, and what your monthly payments will be like is all very valuable informationâall of which you will learn through getting pre-approved.âIf you arenât pre-approved yet and are nervous about the process, I want to hear from you.âSo, why are you waiting? Knowing why you donât feel ready to get pre-approved would help me to better understand and service buyers just like you. The market right now is very competitive. No seller is going to consider a buyer who lacks a pre-approval letter.Â Most listing agents will also contact the lender even after receiving a pre-approval letter to confirm that they are qualified to purchase a home.Â So, if you arenât pre-approved yet and are nervous about the process, I want to hear from you. I would love for you to contact me with your thoughts.Also, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "How is the real estate market? When is the best time to buy or sell a home? Â Iâve read over 100 blogs, talked to a number of different economists, and looked into my crystal ball, and I know for a fact that the best time to buy or sell a house will be when the market shifts in June of 2018.Â Iâm just kidding.Â If anyone tells you when the bottom of the market will be, they are lying to you. Itâs all speculation. Nobody knows exactly when the bottom of the market will happen. All anyone really knows is whatâs going on right now. There are so many variables that come with the real estate market that itâs hard to predict the future. You have to look at how much inventory is available, what the interest rates are, how the job market is doing, and more!Right now, the market is going strong for sellers. Interest rates are still very low. Inventory is growing slightly and demand is still high. I want to challenge you to change your mindset a bit. I meet with buyers and sellers on a daily basis, and I find that a lot of people who approach me have more of an âinvestor mindsetâ than a âfirst-time buyerâ or âquality-of-life mindset.âÂ Stop worrying about how the market is and start focusing on what a home is worth to you. A lot of people are moving for a specific reason: they have to relocate for work, want to be closer to their kids, need a bigger house, need to downsize, or want to upgrade from a condo to a single-family home. The point is, everyone is different and has different needs.Â Recently, a client approached me and said, âI really want to buy a home but I feel like Iâll end up overpaying for a property in this market.âÂ âDonât hold off on your dreams and try to time the market.âThe reality is that if youâre a buyer, youâre going to pay a premium for homes on the market right now. We are in a strong sellerâs market. Still, the best time to buy a home is when you can afford it.Â Becoming a homeowner is about more than making an investment. Yes, your home will go up in value and there are tax benefits each year, but those are the cherry on top. You should buy a home to maximize your quality of life.Â Talk to your lender so that you understand what you can afford. Then, if your agent can find properties that you want at that price point, you should go ahead and buy. The longer you wait, the more risk there is. Thatâs the beauty of buying and owning a home. Your payment will be fixed for 30 years; the same cannot be said if you are renting.Â I know that buyers want to buy at the bottom of the market and sellers want to sell at the top, but timing the market is difficult. Donât hold off on your dreams because you think you might be able to get a house for $10,000 less than you can now. After all, it may not happen, and you could find yourself in a worse situation than you were when you first started thinking about buying.Â If you have any questions about buying a home in our current market, give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "In the industry, we call a home that has been unsuccessful to sell an âexpired listing,â a âcancelled listing,â or even a âwithdrawn listing.âÂ What my team and I have found is that when a home is taken off the market, 60% of those homes still need to sell. So when these kind of homes fall through the cracks, I like to give a call to the seller and see if they would be interested in working with us to help them sell.Sometimes the seller is simply too frustrated by the previous experience to want to dive right back in. They often tell me they arenât willing to go through the listing process again, but would be open to the idea of selling if I already had a buyer in mind.Â Now, I can understand how difficult it is to come back from a failed experience. The feeling of repeating that same process at the risk of failing again can be overwhelming. My team and I assist with 40 to 60 home sales per year, so we know all about how frustrating it can be.Â âYouâre only doing yourself a disservice when you insist an agent just âbring you a buyer.ââGetting a home listed and off the market is a tough, stressful thing to do. But that being said, youâre only doing yourself a disservice when you insist an agent just âbring you a buyer.âIf you are truly interested in selling, and in getting top dollar, the most effective way is to list it on the open market. Putting yourself back out there with the help of the right agent can make a huge difference. After all, how many buyers can I realistically have in mind who will be looking for a home exactly like yours? Statistically speaking, that probably just isnât your best option.Â If you price your home just right or slightly below that point in the open market, youâll almost definitely create a multiple offer situation. That can be two or 20 offers, but either way, multiple offers put you in a good position as a seller.Â When there is competition, the mindset of the buyer will shift from âI want to get the best dealâ to âhow can I get this property?âÂ So, yesâwe could bring just bring you a buyer. However, this wonât be the best way to get top dollar for your property. Listing with an agent who has a strong marketing and pricing strategy will truly be the best option.Â If you want more information or have any other questions, feel free to give me call or send me an email.

        "title": "How Discount Agents Cost More in the Long Run",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "The process of undergoing a real estate transaction can be expensive, which makes it tempting to find ways to cut costs. However, you should really think twice before you hire a discount broker.Â People find me through a number of ways. I get calls all the time from commission shoppers who tell me they found me on YouTube, heard about me through a friend, or saw one of my flyers. After this, they always ask me, âWhat do you charge?âThe truth is that I simply donât have a blanket answer for this. Every situation is different, and that means that the price is too. I do have a commission strategy I charge for most of my clients, but this doesnât factor in my marketing strategy or the amount of money Iâll be investing into a property.So when I get these calls, I tend to tell people that I charge between 4% to 7%. I also tell them that the only way I can give them a definite price is for them to come by so we can work together on making a strategy for their specific circumstances.Â But the industry is very saturated. Not every agent out there has the same experience I do. Newer agents can become desperate to get a listing. In this case, it isnât uncommon that you might find an agent willing to charge you 1%.Â But is the lower cost really worth the lower level of service? Sellers should remember to focus not just on what theyâre paying the agent, but what that agent will be able to help them walk away from the sale with. A sellerâs focus should be on their net profit.Â My team and I are often able to help sellers net them a higher overall profit despite the fact that we charge a higher price than discount brokers.Â âWhat you walk away with is much, much more important than what youâll pay your agent.âConsider the following story. I once got a call from a prospective client who lived in the very same area that I own two homes in. He told me he was thinking of selling his home, but was in a big rush and wanted a good deal. Not only did he want a great commission, he wanted to sell within the next week or two.Â Now, I happened to be out of town at the time, but I told him Iâd be more than happy to meet the next day and see what we could work out. Understanding that he was in a bit of a bind, I asked him to be sure not to sign a contract with another agent since I have such an intimate connection to the area his home was in.Â But when I called the next morning to confirm our appointment, he had done just that. He told me he had listed with another agent who was only charging 1% to list his house. âI need to walk away with the most amount of money,â he said, âso I hired him.âÂ After that, I watched the listing from start to close. Unfortunately, it was a disaster. The home was listed three days after the contract was signed, which meant the agent did nothing to prepare the home, did no pre-marketing, and didnât collaborate with professional photographers or any other vendors.Â In short, the agent made very little effort in the sale. When it eventually went under contract 45 days later, it sold for $670,000â$30,000 less than the goal I would have set for that property. This is a goal Iâm confident I could have helped him meet, since I know the area and my own marketing strategy well enough to know it would have resulted in a closed sale at $700,000.Â So even though he saved a little money on the commission, he got totally burned on the home sale. What you walk away with is much, much more important than what youâll pay your agent.Â If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

      "why-should-you-get-pre-approved-early-html": {
        "title": "Why Should You Get Pre-Approved Early?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "For a few different reasons, Iâve noticed that buyers who arenât ready to get pre-approved tend to give me a bit of pushback. This may be because theyâre afraid of hurting their credit, because they havenât found the right home, or because of any number of other factors.However, this is a case where stepping back to look at the big picture is far more important. Whether youâre looking to buy now or a year from now, getting pre-approved should be your first step. There are ten reasons why this is.1. Getting pre-approved is free and there is no obligation. When you talk to a lender and get pre-approved, what youâre really doing is setting up a roadmap for the home buying process. Overall, youâll create more certainty for yourself. This will help you understand things like the kind of loan youâll need and what price range youâll be able to afford.Â 2.Â Itâs a soft credit inquiry. Many people tend to be nervous about the prospect of pulling their credit to see if they qualify for a loan. FICO understands that you may be getting one, or multiple, pre-approvals as part of the homebuying process. Your credit score may not even be affected. If it is, it will be minimalâpulling your credit to qualify for a home loan isnât the same as a hard credit inquiry like opening a new line of credit at Nordstroms.Â 3. Once you get pre-approved, youâre done. Even though certain banks will tell you that your pre-approval is only good for a certain number of months, this isnât the case so long as your financial situation stays the same or improves. If this is the case, your lender will simply re-issue your pre-approval and youâll be ready-to-go once more.Â 4. You get to learn about different options and loan programs. There are many, many options out there that many buyers arenât even aware of until talking with their lender. So even if you had an idea of what you thought you wanted, the process of getting pre-approved could point you to a different option you like even more.Â 5. You will learn the price range to focus on. I once had a client who told me he wanted to look at homes in the $600,000 price range because that whatâs he assumed he would be approved for. However, after finding one he liked he talked to a lender, got pre-approved, and found out that he qualified for $850,000 price range. Once he found out he could be looking in that range, we realized that we had spent three weeks prior searching for things that were far below what he was able to afford.Â 6. You will understand your monthly payment. Despite what you might be able to afford, hearing how much homes in that price range will actually cost in terms of monthly payments can be daunting. Thereâs no need to buy at the absolute top of your price point. Real estate is all about math, so finding a home youâre comfortable with will be as simple as adjusting the price point until you find a monthly payment that sounds reasonable to you.Â 7. It gives you an opportunity to understand your credit. Many people have imperfect credit, and loan programs tend to work on a tiered system with different levels representing what is available for different credit scores. But even if your credit isnât the best, you can still get pre-approved and start working on raising your score. This way, youâll be able to get a better interest rate, a better loan, and a lower monthly payment.8. You have time to fine-tune things. A client of mine who was pre-approved six months out found out during the process that he had a couple of medical liens on his credit report. This dropped his score by 100 points, which meant he wasnât able to get the best loan or interest rate. Fortunately, after three months with a credit repair company he was able to boost his score back up by 80 points and qualify for a great loan and a great property. If he had gotten pre-approved right before he wanted to buy, he wouldnât have been able to get into the kind of property he wanted.Â 9. It puts you in a position to submit an offer. Buyers with a pre-approval letter are much more attractive to sellers. In fact, many sellers wonât even consider an offer that isnât supplemented with a pre-approval letter.10. Itâs just the right way to do it. As you can see, there are many reasons why pre-approval is so essential. Getting pre-approved, and doing so early, will make a huge difference in your transaction.If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email.

        "title": "Tips for Navigating Our Current Market",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "How is the market doing? Weâre in the middle of a very hot selling season.Â If youâve seen my videos in the past, then you know that inventory starts to grow in March. By May and June, there are a lot more homes on the market than there are in the winter.Â As inventory grows, buyers have more options. As buyers have more options, demand tends to fall. This market is pretty active and aggressive in certain parts, and itâs very unpredictable. When inventory has gone up in the past, the market stabilized and slowed down. That hasnât happened yet, and only time will tell whenâor ifâthe market will slow down at all. Â  Â Still, whether you are buying or selling a home, you have some great opportunities in this market. I have three tips for homebuyers and three tips for sellers to help you succeed.Â âThere are great opportunities in the market for homebuyers and sellers alike.âAs a buyer, you need to:Â 1. Get pre-approved. Sit down with a lender and get educated on what loan options are available in order to understand which one is best for you. Figure out what your monthly payment will be so that you know exactly what youâre getting into. You donât want to purchase a home and then be surprised by an uncomfortably high mortgage payment. Get the pre-approval process started before your home search so that you know your options and have a lot more certainty when you do enter the market.Â 2. Understand exactly what youâre looking for and why. When I sit down with my clients to talk about what theyâre looking for, theyâll rattle off a list of things they want in a home. I always dig deeper by asking why they want those things. Usually, they start to realize that some of the things they are looking for arenât necessarily important when it comes to the big picture. Understanding why youâre looking for something can help you whittle down exactly what you want in a home. After all, when you have too many options, it can be difficult to make a decision and find the right home.Â 3. Have a huddle with your Realtor before you start looking at homes. Sit down with your Realtor and put together a strategy to find your home. Every minute you spend planning saves 10 minutes in execution. If you spend a week putting together a plan, you will save about 10 weeks on your actual home search. You may even avoid getting outbid or missing out on a home that you love. So, sitting down with your agent for 30 or 45 minutes before you start the process will definitely go a long way.Â If you plan on selling in this market, you need to:Â 1. Make sure that your home shows well online and offline. You need to be open to staging and decluttering your home. An interior designer can come through and tell you how to maximize the space in your home. Not every home is perfect; some rooms are smaller than others, so you need to use the right furniture and staging to make your home appeal to buyers.Â A good agent will make sure that you get professional photographs taken of your home. Other options include a video tour of your home or a virtual walkthrough. Many buyers come from out of the area, so they arenât able to see your home in person. Photos and videos are a great indication of what it would be like to live in your home.Â 2. Price your home right. The market is aggressive. Homes are selling quickly and in many cases, with multiple offers. If a home is overpriced, buyers will focus on a seller with a more realistic price. Again, there are more options on the market and your home is not the only one. Itâs important that you understand the market, your active competition, and the current inventory in your area. What did homes sell for in the last month versus three months ago? Pricing your home correctly will allow you to sell quickly without leaving any money on the table.Â 3. Hire an agent with the right marketing plan. Donât just hire an agent based on commission. Generally, an agent who charges more can help you sell for a higher net price. Instead of focusing on what you will pay your agent, focus on what they will do for you and your home. How much will they sell your home for? How will that affect your bottom line? At the end of the day, hire an agent with a strong presence in your area, a great marketing plan, and strong negotiation skills.Â If you are an investor, buying or selling a property can be a bit more complicated, so give me a call if you have any questions about navigating the current market.Â As a homebuyer or seller, those three steps will help lead you to success in this hot market. If you would like to learn more about buying or selling a home, please donât hesitate to reach out to me. I would be happy to help you!",

        "content": "If youâve tried to sell your home in the past but were unsuccessful, todayâs message is for you. How you market your home matters when you list it for sale. Let me share a quick story to show you what I mean.Â In late 2016, I spoke with a homeowner who had listed his home on the market for four months at a price of $485,000. After his listing expired, I introduced myself, told him Iâd done my research on his home, and said I thought $485,000 was a very fair price for the property. I offered to meet with him and strategize how we could still sell his home for a great price, but we went back and forth for about three or four months because he wasnât quite ready to put his home back on the market.Â Finally, in the beginning of 2017, we listed his home for the same exact price as it had been listed before. The only difference was that we actually put forth the time and effort into getting it ready for the market. We had it professionally cleaned, we enlisted a handyman to make some minor repairs to it, and had an interior designer stage it to give buyers that emotional connection they crave when they walk into a property. We also had professional photos taken and used heavy online and offline marketing.Â âIf youâve had an expired listing before, it was probably the marketing that did you in.âAfter receiving multiple offers, we sold the property in two days for $498,000, which was $13,000 more than what he listed it at the first time with his first agent.Â If youâve tried to sell your property in the past and failed, itâs not necessarily the price you were trying to achieve that prevented your home from getting sold. Many times, itâs the marketing and the exposure that your home didnât get that caused it to become an expired listing.Â If you experienced an expired listing before and are thinking you might want to give selling your home another shot, Iâd love to sit down with you and put together a strategy to help you sell your property for a great price.Â If you have any questions about this topic or have any topics youâd like to see me discuss in the future, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "If youâre a homeowner, are you pricing your home to sell?Â If youâve been watching my videos lately, youâve heard me say inventory is low and demand is high. Weâre seeing a lot of homes sell for more than what theyâre worth because buyers donât have a lot of options. The market is beginning to shift just a little bit, and inventory is rising. In fact, inventory has increased 10% month over month since the last time I checked.Â Inventory always rises in April, May, and June. Itâs one of the highest selling seasons of the year, and buyers are usually out in full force looking for properties. Whatâs different about this year, though, is that we should see more inventory than normal. Why?We recently sold a home for the highest price itâs ever been sold. Not long after that, I got a call from a neighbor of the person whose house sold for that record price telling me if I could get them a similar sale price, they would consider selling their home too. That tells me weâre starting to see a lot of sellers who werenât planning on selling their homes deciding to do so anyway because of the prices.Â âIf youâre truly motivated to sell, youâll have to price your home right.âMany of these sellers are working with agents who are pretty optimistic, and weâre starting to see list prices get very high.

Look at the data, be mindful of whatâs going on in your neighborhood, consider the market and the location and condition of your property, and factor in your competition. Your competition is growing, which means buyers have more choices.Â If youâre truly motivated to sell, youâll have to price your home right. If you do, youâll get a great price for it.Â If youâre thinking about selling your home or seeing what itâs worth in our current market, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

Home prices are on the rise, demand is high, interest rates are predicted to rise, and people want to buy a property while a home is still within their reach.Â This isnât the market to be confused in because if you are, you wonât take action and you wonât achieve your real estate goals.Â So whatâs the solution?Â âWork with a Realtor to come up with a strategy so you can be in a position to say yes to a home.âYou want to find a Realtor and lender team that you feel comfortable working with. A lot of buyers work on their own, calling listing agents, checking listing websites, and before they know it, months have gone by and prices and interest rates have risen. So, the best thing you can do is find a Realtor that you know, trust, and can be vulnerable with. Let them know what you want, why you want it, when you want it by, and work with that Realtor to come up with a strategy so you can be in a position to say yes to a home.Â If have any questions about this topic or any other real estate questions, donât hesitate to give me a call or send me an email.

        "content": "This is one of the busiest times of the year for home sellers. More homes will be sold in the next two or three months than any other time of year. How is rising inventory in our market affecting what buyers and sellers should do?Inventory always grows in March and significantly rises in April and May, which is why itâs always a great time for buyers to buy property in the spring and summer months. As inventory rises and buyers have more options, the demand for property falls, homes take longer to sell, and buyers have more options.Currently, there are two types of sellers on the marketâthose whoâve already decided to list their home and those who previously had no intention to sell but are being tempted to do so by favorable prices.For example, I recently sold a home in a neighborhood in Irvine which was probably worth somewhere between $515,000 and $520,000 for $551,000. That was a record price for that neighborhood, and a couple days later, I got a call from the next-door neighbor of that seller. They told me they hadnât planned on selling their home, but if I could get the same price for their property, theyâd be interested in putting it on the market.The emergence of both of these types of sellers is whatâs causing the rise in inventory. If youâre a buyer, get pre-approved and understand what you can afford so thereâs no confusion about what your monthly payment will be and what price point you should focus on.âItâs a great time to be a buyer in our market.âThe good news is itâs a great time to be a buyer. Buyers were getting bullied around in winter, but we should see that trend shift. You should have more properties to look through and more time to make a decision.If youâre a seller, make sure you price your home the right way. Your initial list price should be in line with what the market is telling us. Have you and your Realtor done your research? What have homes in your area sold for in the past? What does your current competition look like? Without knowing whatâs going in your local market, you wonât be able to price your home to sell.The market is shifting a little bit, but the mindset of most sellers and their agents hasnât shifted. These people are still pricing their homes optimistically as if we were still in January, February, or March. That market changes on a monthly basis, though, and weâre entering a whole new one.If you have any questions for me or youâre looking to buy or sell a home, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

The inventory is down by almost 30%, and the pending sales are up close to 20%. Homes are selling as fast as they are being listed.An appraiser is going to look at past sales data to come up with your homeâs worth. Theyâll take info from past sales and give you a market value. There is a disconnect between what an appraiser does and what an agent does, however. While an appraiser uses past sales data on its own, an agent like myself looks at everything, including inventory and pending sales data, to figure out how to market the property in order to get the highest possible offer.âWhat a home is worth and what it sells for can be two different things.âLet me tell you a short but exciting story about how having different opinions of a homeâs value can help you. I recently took a listing in north Irvine. The home was probably worth between $510,000 and $515,000 as far as the appraiser was concerned. However, we knew that we could price a little aggressively in this market, so we decided to list it for $520,000.The end result was that we had more than 250 people come to the open house, we received nine offers, and ended up selling the home within three days for $550,000. Is the home worth that much? To this buyer in this market, it sure was.The message out there for all you homeowners considering selling is that you need to talk to an agent to understand not only what your home is worth now, but what it could sell for based on all of the external factors.If you have any questions for us or youâre interested in buying or selling a home in Orange County, donât hesitate to give us a call or send us an email.

He got his listing contract signed, put a sign in the front of the house, took some photos, and started showing it three days after he met the seller.The â4-1 ruleâ is something that we utilize on most of our listings, especially those that were unsuccessful at selling in the past. It boils down to spending four weeks preparing the home to sell so that it can sell within one week of being listed on the MLS. Nine out of 10 sellers who follow this rule end up winning.â90% of our sellers who follow this rule end up winning.âWhy do we need four whole weeks to get your home ready? Well, every situation is different, but there are always things we can do to improve a homeâs appearance. A typical home needs some minor repairs and a deep cleaning at the very least. We also take photos, shoot video, create flyers, pre-market the home online, and stage it.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "If youâre not careful, you might be late to the party thatâs happening in our market. Let me explain what I mean. Â If you watched my February market update, you heard me say that inventory had fallen 28% compared to February 2016. You also heard me say that the number of pending sales in escrow was up 19% compared to February 2016. The market was hot then, and itâs hot now. Inventory has significantly decreased, the number of homes sales has significantly increased, and homes are selling faster than theyâre being listed.Â I ran some numbers this morning and found out that inventory rose 4.6% from February to March, but the kicker is that pending sales also rose 17.9% in that same time span. This means homes are still selling faster than theyâre being listed even though inventory is slightly growing. Iâve mentioned several times in the past that inventory would rise in April because, historically, it always does. This makes April and May great months to buy properties because buyers have so many choices.Â Conversely, one of the best times to sell a property is during the winter months because thereâs not a lot of inventory during January, February, and March. With no inventory, thereâs more demand because buyers have fewer choices. This year the same situation is happening, only compounded. Not only is it a great time of year to sell a property for a great price, but inventory is the lowest itâs been in 10 years, and demand hasnât been this high in over a decade either. We only have 1.5 months of inventory on the market. A normal, balanced market has six months of inventory, so weâre clearly in a sellerâs market.Â This is why I ask if youâre going to be late to the party. As word spreads about how great our market is, more people will become more interested in what they can potentially sell their home for. If youâre a home seller, you always want to sell during a time when buyers have limited options. If you wait too long, you might have more competition to deal with among other sellers. That is to say, if you wait until April, May, or June to list your property, youâll be late to the party. By then, everyone else will have caught onto this trend.Â âConsider listing your home now so youâre not late to the party.âIf youâre thinking about selling your property, now is the time to consider pulling the trigger. Everyoneâs situation is a little bit different, so I always recommend talking to a Realtor before making a decision. My team and I would be glad to consult with you in that regard.Â What about buyers? Whatâs happening in the market for them? If youâre a buyer, itâs no secret that youâll be paying a premium for a home right now. However, look at your big-picture goals to determine whether you should make a move. If youâve spoken to a lender, you understand what your monthly mortgage payment is, and you find the right property that you plan on staying in for at least five to seven years, then now might be a great time to buy. If youâre looking for a short-term purchase or an investment flip, however, now might not be the best time.Â The bottom line is inventory is still low, demand is still high, and most homes are selling at record speeds for more than what theyâre worth. If you have any questions youâd like to ask my team and I, give us a call or send us an email. Until then, happy selling!Â ",

        "content": "When is the right time to buy your new home?Before I answer that question today, I want to be clear that every buyerâs situation is different. Just because itâs the right time for one buyer to buy a home doesnât necessarily mean itâs the right time for you to do so. Always check with a lender to understand your overall financial situation and whether buying a home makes sense for you.Now, there are two important trends Iâm seeing in our market. The first involves interest rates. Every buyer wants to buy their new home and secure the absolute lowest possible interest rate because the savviest ones know that they affect their monthly payments. On the flip side, inventory is super low. Itâs been low since last November and we wonât see it rise significantly until April or May.This combination has led me to come across a lot of buyers telling me they want to buy a house now because rates are so great but they canât find what they want. They want to know if they should wait until inventory rises to make their move.Again, there is no right answer. It has to make sense to you in terms of what you can afford. In a best-case scenario, youâll find the right home at the right price. The sooner you find it, the better. Rates may rise in the next couple months, but if you wait that long, youâll also have more options as a buyer because of the rebound in inventory.âSeek the right balance between a great interest rate and a great property.âYour goal should be to find the right balance between a great interest rate and a great property. That will be your recipe for success.If you have any questions about this topic or have a specific situation youâd like to talk to me about in person, donât hesitate to reach out to me.

        "content": "If youâre interested in selling your home in the very near future, exposure is critical. I want to share a quick story with you to explain why.Â Once upon a time, I was referred to a wonderful prospect in Laguna Beach. Keep in mind, my office is based out of Irvine. I met with this woman and shared my entire marketing plan and selling strategy for her home. Everything seemed like it was working out perfectly.Â A few days later, however, she called me to tell me she would no longer do business with me. As it turns out, she heard from a friend that sheâd be better off using a local Laguna Beach agent instead of me because they offered her the chance to sell her property off-market.This kind of thing happens sometimes, and I respected her decision and wished her all the best. But if she was having these thoughts, maybe other people out there were having them too.Â That brings me to my message for today. When youâre going through the home buying process and looking for a great listing agent, the decision shouldnât automatically fall on whoever is the most local. You want to find the person who will expose your home to the most amount of qualified buyers. When youâre selling a home, there are many factors that go into the process, but exposure is critical.âPick a listing agent who will exposure your home to the highest number of qualified buyers.âReal estate is no longer localâitâs global. People are relocating from all over the world to live in our beautiful area. While I can see where this person was coming from about wanting a local Realtor who might have buyers looking for her home, I also wonder why her other agent would want to limit her property to only local buyers when somebody outside the area was probably going to buy the property anyway.Â If youâre a seller, interview whoever you think you need to, but focus on who will expose your home to the highest number of qualified and motivated buyers. The more people that know about your home, the more activity your home sale will generate. More activity means a higher chance of multiple offers. At that point, you wonât leave any money on the table. As a seller, I assume thatâs what you ultimately want.If you have a specific question for me, give me a call or send me an email and Iâd be happy to discuss anything you want to talk about.

        "content": "When you ask how the market is doing, itâs important to focus on which emotions are driving the market forward.The market is currently pretty strong for home buyers and sellers alike. Prices are slowly moving up but so are interest rates, so you want to consider all of these factors before buying or selling.The two emotions we see right now are fear and desperation. Fear of interest rates rising, prices rising, and fear that you might not be able to afford a home in the next six months are driving buyer activity. Desperation comes from low inventoryâbuyers are worried about finding the perfect home before rates go up. Weâre seeing people overpay for properties because of fear and people settling for properties that arenât a good fit because of desperation.Â âFear and emotion are driving our market right now.âWho you hire as your agent matters now more than ever before. As an agent, the advice I give a seller will be very different than the advice I give a buyer. Iâm trying to help maximize the goals of whoever Iâm working with. I want to help sellers get top dollar and I want to help buyers find the best house for the best price.Â So what does this all mean?Â As a buyer, itâs a great time to buy because interest rates are still historically low. If you buy a home in the next three months, youâll probably secure a rate in the low 4% range. Inventory is slowly growing and weâll start to see it rise around March and rise even more significantly in April. You want to find that balance of waiting long enough to have more options, but not waiting so long that rates rise and prices rise to a point where you canât afford the home that you really want. Donât forget to get pre-approved for a mortgage, either. Knowing your price point can override your emotions.As for sellers, we havenât seen this good of a time to list your house in a long time. Inventory is so low that buyers have few options and the demand is very high. As a seller, you want to leverage a buyerâs emotions because thatâs what will put money in your pocket.I hope you found todayâs topic valuable and informative.

Iâm writing this for the last groupâthose of you looking to hire a new agent to sell your home.My recommended strategy has always been to interview three or four new agents for the job of selling your home. Every agent has a different personality, strategy, network of service providers, marketing plan, etc. If youâve seen my articles in the past, you know that not all agents are created equally. As youâre interviewing them, keep these things in mind:âInterview three or four agents for the job of selling your home.â1. The connection. You need to make sure you have a good connection with the Realtor youâre considering hiring. You want to have a good rapport and open lines of communication. Selling a home can be overwhelming and if you donât have a great relationship with your Realtor, the expected outcome can not be good.2. Understand what the Realtorâs marketing plan is. How will they get the word out and maximize the exposure of your property? How are the buyers out there going to know your home is for sale? A good marketing strategy is so important.3. Social proof. Ask the agent youâre considering what their track record is and what they can do for you that will inspire you to hire them.

        "content": "There are three things most people look for when buying a home:1. Location. 53% of buyers will focus on location first. They want to be close to their place of work, their family, great schools, or amenities, like the beach. Location is, without a doubt, the most important feature for buyers.2. Price. Many buyers will buy with a loan, so theyâll have a monthly payment, property taxes, utility bills, HOA fees, and all the other expenses that come with the territory of buying a house. Most buyers we work with try to stay within a certain price point so that theyâre not out of their comfort zone. We to make sure theyâre not âhouse poor.â3. Layout. They want to make sure the home flows well and that they can imagine themselves living in the home and creating memories.Â âThese are the three things about a home that you donât have  the ability to change.âKeep in mind that these are three things you canât necessarily change. Your home isnât going to move, so you have to be happy in that location. Price is a matter of staying in your financial comfort zone in your monthly payment. You also need to be happy with the layout because most buyers wonât have enough money to seriously reconfigure their homeâs layout.Â I hope this gives you a new way to think about whatâs important when buying a home. If you have any questions about buying a home or you have other real estate topics youâd like to see me discuss in a video, feel free to give me a call, send me an email, or leave a comment on our website or social media pages.Â I look forward to hearing from you!",

        "content": "If you havenât already heard, the Fed met this month and interest rates have gone up. They also announced that they will be increasing them three more times in 2017. This is going to cause the cost of homeownership to rise over time when it comes to your monthly payment.The cost of owning a home today has already gone up from just last week because of the increases. What does this mean for buyers and sellers?âSavvy buyers are moving   up their timelines.âThe most savvy buyers out there are moving up their timelines. If they were looking to buy in the next six months, they are now looking to buy in the next two. They know that interest rates are volatile and the longer they wait, the more they will have to pay for their home.For the sellers out there, you canât sell your home unless you have a buyer. If buyers are moving up their timeline and looking to buy in January or February, sellers would miss out on a lot of these buyers by waiting until spring to sell. In the spring, inventory dramatically increases and youâll have much more competition. That equals less demand for your home.If youâre looking to buy and have the lowest payment possible each month, the sooner you purchase the better. I hope this advice helps anybody who is curious about whatâs going on in the real estate market and how the Fed increasing the rate will affect you.If you have any questions for me at all, donât hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Are you considering selling your home and upgrading to something bigger? If so, should you do that now in winter or wait until the spring?First, I want to give you an update on how our market is doing. Inventory levels are still really low here in Orange County. Weâre currently looking at two monthâs worth. That means if no new homes are listed, based on how fast homes are selling now, weâd have nothing left on the market in two months. This puts us in a strong sellerâs market.Â Additionally, prices are still going up. Despite many peopleâs suspicions about how the election would affect prices, weâre still seeing them rise. Interest rates, unfortunately, are also on the rise. If youâre a buyer looking for the lowest possible monthly payment, the sooner you buy, the better your monthly payment is gong to be.Â If youâre looking to sell your current home and buy something bigger, the best time to list your current home is in January or early February. This is because inventory levels in January, February, and March stay pretty low. When inventory levels are low, demand is high. As a homeowner, you want high demand for your home so you can get top dollar for it. In April and May, inventory significantly increases, so if you wait until the spring market to list your home, youâre going to have a lot more competition and a lot less demand.Â âThe trick is to list your home when inventory levels are low.âThe reason why itâs a great idea to list your home in January or very early February is because it takes a few weeks to get your home ready to sell, and it takes a certain amount of time to market your property and show it to different buyers. In addition, you have to deal with the escrow period, which can take anywhere from four to six weeks.Â In a perfect world, if you list your home in mid- to late-January, youâll be in a position to buy at the very end of March or early Aprilâjust in time for the inventory surge. Not only have you already sold your home for a record price because you sold it during a time when inventory was low, but now that youâre buying in April, inventory has increased and given you more options and less demand to deal with. As a buyer, youâre going to able to buy your home at a much better price.If you have any questions about a specific scenario or a video idea youâd like me to cover in the future, please donât hesitate to reach out to me. Iâd love to hear from you. Until then, happy selling!",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Pretty much every time I meet with a homeowner that wants to sell their property, they want to know what they can upgrade to increase their sale price. I always recommend making small repairs and sprucing up your property before you sell. However, I donât really encourage my clients to make big upgrades right before selling.Â Big upgrades should be reserved for those homeowners who live in their home and are not thinking about selling. If youâre going to make upgrades to your property, you want to be able to enjoy them yourself. Making upgrades right before selling is counterproductive because not only do you not get to enjoy the upgrades, you likely wonât be able to recover 100% of the money you spent, and you definitely wonât get more back than what you put in. It just doesnât make any sense.âDonât make upgrades you wonât be able to enjoy.âThe best time to make upgrades is when you can afford them, of course, but also when you have time to enjoy them. If youâve always wanted stainless steel appliances or a granite countertop, get it so you can enjoy it. When you do decide to sell, at least your home will be upgraded and you will get to enjoy it. You wonât get what you spend on upgrades back if you make them right before you sell.Â If you have any questions for me or any suggestions for future video topics, give me a call or send me an email. You can also comment below. Either way, we would love to hear from you soon. Until then, happy selling!",

			<p>All of our clients come with a real story and no two clients we work with are ever alike. Everyone is unique and thatâs what makes real estate so interesting and exciting at the Robert Mack Group. There isnât a one size fits all approach, and it truly takes a talented group of individuals working together as a team to create structure in an industry full of chaos, emotion, excitement, and fear! Maybe youâre a terrified first time home buyer and scraping together everything you have just to own your own home? You could be a family of 3 or 4 running out of room, and itâs time to upgrade to a bigger home? Did you try to sell once and werenât able to and now you need a new approach. Have your kids all grown up and moved out, and you need to downsize? Maybe you just got married, or are going through a divorce? Life is unpredictable sometimes. Real estate is more than just opening doors or showing homes. Itâs not just about putting a sign out front of your home and putting it online. Itâs about people. People who need help to buy or sell a home for one reason or another. If you are looking to sell your current home, buy a new home, or both, weâd like to learn more. There is never any cost or obligation to meet with us for a private consultation, to determine if we are the right fit for you.</p>

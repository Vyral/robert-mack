<p class ="testimonial-text"><p>I can't recommend the Robert Mack Group enough, they somehow made the entire process of buying and selling a house easy! Every single step outlined below of working with Robert and his group greatly exceeded expectations, which is why I can only give no less than 5 stars. The Interview: We interviewed many realtors before Robert, they were all unsure of themselves and far too eager to make a quick sale. Robert came in clear, concise, and with a strategy that made sense. Selling (Pre-Market): Once we decided to go with Robert's team, they went straight to work. We came up with a great pricing strategy that put mine and my wife's best interests first. An interior decorator was brought in to give tips on how to properly stage the house, even giving us advice on how we could DIY a lot of it to avoid staging costs. For advertising they used their arsenal of networking tools, captured beautiful professional pictures, and even made an incredible 3D rendering of the property to give prospective buyers a virtual tour! Selling (On the Market): An extreme benefit of the Robert Mack Group is well... the Group. His team was extremely helpful with stepping in and fielding open houses, private showings, and letting us know what was going on through the entire process. BIG shout-out to Kristy for pretty much holding our hands through the whole thing (buying side as well). The mass amounts of foot traffic and buzz our place generated concluded with us selling our place FAR above what we expected. The other realtors that we interviewed told us we were dreaming trying to sell for what we did, Robert made it a reality and then some. Buying: Robert was extremely proactive and showed an incredible amount of urgency in putting our name at the top of the list when there were properties we were interested in. He was able to not only have the seller cancel their open house, but accept our offer BELOW asking price. Either Robert is a witch-doctor or he's just really good at his job. With all that said, go with the Robert Mack Group if you want a professional experience with professional results. Don't risk going with an amateur and leaving heaps of money on the table.</p>

<p class ="testimonial-text"><p>"I worked with Robert and his team for most of 2018. The sale of our home was challenging to say the least but his team helped from the very beginning. Robert and his staff were very hands on, they helped us with every aspect of the sale. Robert has so many contacts and resources that doing the prep, staging, and repairs was actually the easiest part! I can't thank them enough! Robert, Tania, Kristy, Mike and Ryan's worked tirelessly to sell our home. Their hard work and dedication is unprecedented. It was indeed a team effort. They handled everything with professionalism, poise, and grace. Once our property was sold, they helped me transition to a new rental property. They orchestrated and assisted with this process, which was new and different from being a home owner so, it was grateful to have an expert team. I cannot say enough good things about Robert and his team. I highly recommend The Robert Mack Group whether you are looking to buy, lease/rent, or sell a home or a combination of them. Love and adore this team!!!</p>

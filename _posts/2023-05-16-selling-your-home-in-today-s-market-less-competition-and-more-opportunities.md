Are you thinking about listing your home in today’s crazy market? If so, there are three things you need to know:&nbsp;

**1\. Many sellers are staying put, so you’ll have less competition.** Many sellers want to keep their low interest rates and monthly payments, and they’re worried about the lack of inventory when they turn around and buy. Therefore, if you need to sell today, you’ll face almost no competition.&nbsp;

**2\. Demand is very high.** Less competition is driving up demand, so know that a lot of people want to buy your home. A great property at a great price almost always gets multiple offers in this current climate, and multiple offers mean record sales prices.&nbsp;

**3\. Your strategy matters.** Too many sellers think that because the market is hot, they can just list their house as-is and see what they get. However, that’s the worst way to sell a home. You need the right agent to help you form the right strategy. Then you can get at least 10% more for your sales price.&nbsp;

These tips will help when you list your home. If you have any questions or want our help selling, please don’t hesitate to reach out! You can call or email us anytime, and we would be happy to help you get the most for your home.

Whether you plan to put your home on the market in the next month or in the next couple of years, there are three things that you need to focus on as a seller when you’re working with an agent to list your home for sale. Fortunately for you, it all comes down to marketing. **I’ve broken our marketing strategy into three parts:**

**1\. Price.** Think about a time when a product you were waiting to buy suddenly dropped in price. What did that make you want to do? Chances are that it made you want to go out there and get it right away. When it comes to listing your home, my team uses several different pricing strategies depending on the client, the market, and what our goals are. That said, how you price a property directly affects the number of buyers who will see your home.

**2\. Home preparation.** That doesn’t necessarily mean home upgrades, although sometimes it may. Most of the time, the goal is to take the property and use the resources and time available to us to make it look as good as possible when it goes live on the market. Sometimes that involves cleaning the carpets, interior/exterior paint touch-ups, deep cleaning, and/or making minor repairs.

**3\. Traditional real estate marketing.** Word of your home’s availability will be sent to everyone via the MLS, which is the primary database that all agents use. Through the MLS, your listing will also be sent to other, third-party consumer websites such as Zillow, Redfin, Realtor.com, Trulia, Homes.com, and so many other sites.&nbsp;

Beyond those, there are other online and offline strategies available (too many to list here), but the one unifying fact behind them all is that selling is all about psychology The higher the emotional connection a buyer has with a property that you’re selling, the more they’ll be willing to pay.

We in the Robert Mack Group specialize in telling a story. Buyers love them; it doesn’t matter what they’re buying, if there’s a story behind it, it means there’s more value behind it. We tell stories using tactics like print advertising, and mail.

If you want the best price for your home, you have to work with an agent who understands how to market using price, preparation, and all the resources available to us to help get the word out.

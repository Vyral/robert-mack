Do you need a new agent?

If you worked with an agent in the past who was unable to sell your listing within a given amount of time, the agency relationship you had expires and the home is taken off the market.&nbsp;

There are a lot of options sellers have when it comes to relisting. However, **relisting with the same agent won’t be effective if they plan to do things exactly the same as they did the first time.&nbsp;**

I appreciate that people are loyal to their agents, but if your agent was unable to sell your home the first time, what are they going to do differently if you choose to list with them again?

**It’s entirely possible that you might need to work with a totally new agent.** If you spend some time interviewing different agents, you’ll have the opportunity to learn more about all of the many ways they could market and sell your home.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;

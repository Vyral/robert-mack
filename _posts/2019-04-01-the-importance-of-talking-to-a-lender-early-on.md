Over 85% of all buyers start looking at homes before speaking with a lender. Unfortunately, this is the worst way you can go about a purchase.

Whether you’re actively preparing to buy a home or the desire to buy has just occurred to you, it’s never too soon to meet with a lender and talk about your goals.

Some buyers assume that by getting pre-approved, they’ll be put under pressure to buy right away. This isn’t the case at all. **Talking with a lender and getting pre-approved will simply help guide your search and ensure that when you do find the perfect home, you’ll be ready to act.** An opportunity to talk with a lender is an opportunity for you to educate yourself about your position as a buyer. And by having this conversation early, you’ll have additional time to improve your financial health if you don’t qualify right away.

2\. An understanding of what you can afford.

3\. An understanding of your current credit score.

4\. An understanding of what your monthly payment will be.

**There’s no cost or obligation associated with this meeting.** Talking with a lender will simply help you strategize your upcoming home purchase.

Many Americans are wondering whether we’re in the midst of a housing market bubble. A lot of people still have painful memories of the crash in 2008, and they’re concerned that history is about to repeat itself. However, there’s currently no data that supports the possibility of another housing market crash. A lot of this has to do with forbearance, which is what we’ll be talking about today.

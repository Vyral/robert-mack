**If you’re currently looking for a home to buy, I’ve got some great news for you today.** I remember back in 2015 when I was talking to a potential homebuyer who felt that he was going to be paying too much for his property. At the time, he was hesitant but still decided to pull the trigger.

These days, he is very grateful that he bought at that point because the home is worth 15% more now than it was when he bought it. He may have paid a premium for the property, but he’s already made that back and then some. Instead of paying rent for those three years, he’s been able to invest in his own mortgage and see the appreciation for himself. **Three years later, the situation is similar in our market.&nbsp;**

You might pay a premium for a home now, but you’ll find that it’s a great deal in a few years. My mentor used to tell me that “The best deal is the home that you can afford to buy right now.”

If you’re a homebuyer and you’re looking to buy a property or you’ve been renting for a long time, talk to a lender today and figure out what it will take to buy a property. If you can afford it and it’s within your comfort zone, it’s time to pull the trigger. **The home appreciation and tax benefits alone make it a worthwhile investment.**

If you have any questions for me about buying a home or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Today, I'm addressing all the homeowners out there who have built up substantial equity. Have you ever wondered what the savvy homeowners are doing with it? Well, I've come across two types of people. The first type loves having a significant amount of equity in their property as it provides security and peace of mind. If that's you, then continue with what you're doing.

However, if you're a homeowner thinking, "I have a substantial amount of equity, and I want to explore ways to create wealth and expand my portfolio," then here are the top three strategies our clients are utilizing with their equity.

Firstly, **they are pulling out their equity and investing it in home improvements.** This not only enhances their quality of life while living in the property but also ensures that these capital improvements increase the potential sale value in the future.

Secondly, **some homeowners are purchasing a new primary residence and converting their old home into a rental property.** By leveraging the equity from their current property, they buy a new home, move in, and turn their previous house into a valuable rental asset as they continue to grow their portfolio.

Lastly, **some homeowners choose to remain in their current home while extracting the equity and using it to acquire investment properties.** This approach allows them to build their portfolio while still enjoying the comforts of their own home.

There are various paths to explore when it comes to utilizing your equity. Ultimately, if you find yourself sitting on a substantial amount of equity and seeking ways to increase your future wealth, this is an excellent starting point.

Today, I want to address anyone out there who has tried listing in the past but was unsuccessful in doing so. In the industry, we call these expired listings.&nbsp;

When a seller hires an agent for a certain amount of time and their property doesn’t sell for whatever reason, the home is taken off the multiple listing service and the agreement between the agent and seller is cancelled.&nbsp;

Now, these kinds of listings are something I follow closely in our market. Sometimes I see listings that have previously expired go back on the market with the same photos, the same staging, the same price, and maybe even the same agent.&nbsp;

Usually, the same strategy will reap the same results. **If you tried a strategy for your listing once, it probably isn’t going to work again.** You might get lucky, but chances are that it just won’t work out.

So, if you’ve had an expired listing and you want to put the property back on the market, it may be time for a dramatic change.&nbsp;

There are two things you can do to change your outcome. **If you don’t want to change anything about the property, you’re going to need to dramatically change the price.**

**If you don’t want to change the price, then you’re going to need to change the property.** Maybe this means hiring a staging company, repainting, or even decluttering. All of these things can help make a visible change for buyers.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

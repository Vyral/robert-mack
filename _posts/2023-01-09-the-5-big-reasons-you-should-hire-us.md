Today I want to talk to you about five reasons why, if you're looking for a great real estate agent and team to help you buy or sell, you should consider the Robert Mack group. Let's jump right in:

**1\. Market knowledge.** The real estate market is extremely dynamic. It can change on a weekly basis. On a monthly basis, for sure. If you're not working with a real estate agent and a team that is constantly staying ahead of the curve with what's going on in the market, you're not going to win. So working with a team that understands that is a huge plus.

**2\. Process knowledge.** The real estate process, whether you're buying or selling, can be extremely complicated. The one thing that we pride ourselves on at the Robert Mack Group is making sure that we offer the highest level of customer service to our clients and as much predictability as possible because predictability creates certainty in a transaction. That's what buyers and sellers like. So every time we go through a buy or sale side of a transaction, we will audit it to see how it went. Did anything go wrong? Can we improve on our process? What can we do to get ahead of this type of hiccup? We're always looking for ways to improve.

**3\. Experience and negotiation.** This is my 17th year in the industry, and I'm not just saying that if you've been doing it for a long time, you have a lot of experience. Like every year, we've continued to grow. Year after year, we've continued to network with the best agents locally and across the country. We continue to pay for high-level coaching to make sure that we are the absolute best for our customers and our clients. We’ve sold hundreds of homes over the last 15 years. We have a big data pool, and we understand how buyers and sellers think. So experience and negotiation are crucial when you're choosing to work with an agent. It's not just about putting a sign in the front yard, putting the property on the Internet, and getting offers. It's about reviewing those offers. It's about negotiating with those offers. It's about making sure that when you sell or buy a property, the price and the terms make sense, and you have someone fighting for you.

**4\. Structure and predictability as a team.** That's the one thing that's different between the Robert Mack Group and maybe a bunch of other solo agents that are out there working. It’s that the real estate process is so complicated one person can't do it all. So when you hire the Robert Mack group, you're hiring eight people to work on your behalf. Whatever your goals are, they become our goals. And collectively, as a team, we work together in unison to help you get exactly what you want.

**5\. Social proof.** The proof is in the pudding. Go online, and check our Yelp reviews. Check our Google reviews. Check our Zillow reviews. Here's the bottom line. We grow our business by referral. We are able to help more people when we do great work for our clients. If we work for a client and they're not happy with the level of service that we offer, and they don't refer us any business; that's not good business practice.

So we are constantly finding ways to over deliver on our promise to our clients because we want to generate more referrals and help our clients, friends, and family. And that's how the circle of life goes. So if you have a real estate need, reach out. Give us a call or shoot us an email. We’d be happy to over deliver for you.

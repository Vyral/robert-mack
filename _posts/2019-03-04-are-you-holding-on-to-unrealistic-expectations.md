A lot of buyers recently seem to be holding their breath in hopes that home prices will soon drop.

However, according to top economists, this isn’t likely to happen anytime soon. In fact, the opposite will most likely occur.

**Appreciation may be slowing, but values are still projected to continue rising over time.** With that said: Stop waiting around for prices to drop.

If you’re looking to strike a deal and find the perfect home, now is the time to act. No one has a crystal ball, but it’s fairly likely that the deal you’d be able to earn today is better than what you could secure a year from now. The future is uncertain, but the opportunities available in our current market are clear. Rates are still at historic lows, affordability is still high, and there are plenty of great properties out there right now.

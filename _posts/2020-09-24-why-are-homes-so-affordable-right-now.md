<p style="text-align:center"><em>Why are homes more affordable now than ever before? Let’s discuss this.</em></p>

One of my old mentors told me a long time ago that prices are a one-time thing; your monthly payments and your interest rates are what you have to see every month.

If you were to buy a $1-million property today with a 3.25% interest rate and 20% down, your monthly payment would be $3,482. If those rates went up to 4.25%, your monthly payment would be $3,936—that’s a $500-difference for just a 1% increase\!

&nbsp;If you’re thinking about waiting until prices fall to make a purchase, here are&nbsp;**a few questions to consider to decide whether it makes sense to buy now or wait:**

**1\. How much will prices fall when they do?** Based on the inventory and demand in our market, I don’t see prices falling more than 10%. I think we’ll see prices stabilize in the future and maybe drop by 3% to 5% depending on the area. However, I do see interest rates rising by 1% as the world and economy get stronger.

**2\. When is that price fall going to happen?** Do you think it will happen in six months? 12 months? 18 months? It’s hard to be sure. And for that matter…

**3\. How high will prices be?** If prices from today’s market rise 15% over the next 18 months and then begin to fall, they’re going to have to fall another 15% to get to a point where buyers feel like they’re getting the deal they’ve been waiting for.

**4\. How high will the interest rates be when the prices fall?** Interest rates are much more likely to rise than prices are to fall, which is why I believe you’ll get a better deal buying a home now than you will in 12 to 24 months when the prices fall. In my opinion, many buyers are going to be paying more per month for a home they bought for less.&nbsp;

For sellers in the market, know that I haven’t seen a better time to sell a property than right now. If you’re waiting to liquidate your assets to take that money and do something else with it, you probably still have more time. **The market is likely still going to appreciate, though there’s no guarantee**—the election is coming up, unemployment is still high, and the pandemic is still active.&nbsp;

We don’t know for sure what the future is going to look like, but if you list your home now, you’ll almost certainly get a great price for it if you work with the right agent, price your home correctly, and improve its condition. You might get a little more for it in six months, but whether or not you should wait and see depends on your bigger-picture plans.

**For those who are selling their homes in order to buy a new one, right now is the time to make it happen.** Those low interest rates work in your favor, too, and they might not be around forever.

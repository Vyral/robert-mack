Is the market starting to crack? We are starting to see some pretty big changes in our market. Over the last few years, homes have been appreciating 20% to 30% year over year, which is pretty extreme. Buyers have been looking for any sort of relief, and I think we’re starting to see the market decelerate. We’re not seeing a crash or a drop; it’s just slowing down, and there are some key indicators that tell us about this change.

When you’re thinking of buying or selling a home, I always recommend that you interview two or three agents before making your decision. **Everyone has different wants and needs, and not every Realtor is created equal.&nbsp;**

Each Realtor you’ll meet will have a different approach to the real estate process. In my opinion, the real estate process is about 20% real estate and 80% relationship.&nbsp;

You’ll want to work with someone you trust and feel comfortable with.&nbsp;

This is why every time I talk to someone new, I tell them that I would never want them to hire me unless they truly believe I am the best person for the job.&nbsp;

**When you choose an agent, you should do so because you feel they are the best.** Don’t pick an agent just because they are the cheapest. You need to truly work with the person who you think will do the best job.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

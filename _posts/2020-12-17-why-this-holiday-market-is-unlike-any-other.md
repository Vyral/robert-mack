This Orange County housing market is relentless, and it’s time for an update on how the holidays are affecting everything. Generally, everything slows down during the holiday season, and only the most motivated buyers and sellers stay in the market. Now, however, we’re seeing a very different market. Inventory is low and demand is falling but not for the reasons you might think. If you’re a buyer or seller, you might be pleasantly surprised by the opportunities out there.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about our Orange County housing market or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help, and **I hope you have a wonderful holiday season** and a great start to 2021. Happy selling\!

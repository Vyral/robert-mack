"How can you find an agent you can trust?” Recently, a potential client, who was a total stranger, called me. She was interested in buying a home in the area and asked about the rental returns. Many factors affect this, but it’s difficult to give an accurate estimate without understanding the specific situation. The more specific and vulnerable our clients are with us, the better we can serve them. However, this requires trust. People are reluctant to share personal information with someone they just met at an open house or online. If you want to build trust with an agent, here are three things you can do:

**1\. Get a referral.** 68% of our business comes from referrals. If a friend or family member has worked with an agent they trust and recommend, that's a good start.

**2\. Look online.** Nowadays, people find everything online, including real estate agents. Read reviews and interview a few agents to find the right fit.

**3\. Get your boots on the ground.** Attend open houses and talk to different listing agents. This way, you can learn more about what they do and how they can serve you.

Remember, you won't have an amazing real estate experience unless you work with an agent you trust. Once you find the right fit, you can be specific and vulnerable with them, and work together toward the same goal. If you have any questions about this or need help buying, call or email me, I’m here to help.

Is it time for you to start working with a new Realtor?&nbsp;

I spend a portion of my day every day calling homeowners who were previously unsuccessful in selling their property, whether the listing failed, was withdrawn, or even expired.&nbsp;

Over the years, **I’ve found that 40% of these homeowners will relist their home within eight weeks.** Of that 40%, 80% will choose a new agent.&nbsp;

Selling your home is no easy task. Ultimately, it can be a hassle. You have to open up your home to strangers, always keep it clean, and allow potential buyers to walk through at all times of the day.&nbsp;

If you’ve been through this process once and were unsuccessful, the last thing you want to do is try again with the same Realtor and the same methods. When people go to relist, they’ll often interview a few new agents, instead.&nbsp;

Today, I would like to extend an offer to you. I would like to be the one to help you sell your home. **My team and I do things a little differently, and selling listings that have failed in the past requires a different strategy.** We have some unorthodox strategies for pricing and marketing that we would like to share with you.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Listen buyers: You can’t have it all… or can you? Most buyers want a fantastic home, a reasonable price, and a low interest rate. Think about last year when our housing market was on fire. Prices were crazy high, and inventory was practically non-existent. The only thing that market had going for it was a crazy-low interest rate.&nbsp;

Compare that market to our current one. There are tons more options for you to choose from, prices are negotiable, but interest rates are a little bit higher. Fortunately, we have lenders in our network who will offer you the lowest interest rate possible guaranteed. **If rates drop, they’ll refinance your loan for free.&nbsp;**

If you want to get in touch with one of these lenders, call or email me. Also, don’t forget to send me any video ideas you’d like to see me cover. I look forward to hearing from you\!

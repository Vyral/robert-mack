It is so challenging as a real estate agent, a buyer, or a seller to get a grasp of what's going on in real estate sometimes. Today I want to talk about this crazy market and whether housing is becoming unaffordable. I’ll walk you through some statistics and also compare them to what we've seen in the past. That way, you can make the best decisions for yourself and your family. Whether you're buying or you're selling, it's all about the numbers, so if we remove emotion from the process, you're going to have a much easier time navigating this real estate market.

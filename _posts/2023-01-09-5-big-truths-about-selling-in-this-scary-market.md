I want to talk to you guys about five truths you need to know before you get ready to list your home:

**1\. Home preparation.** Home preparation is pretty much the most important thing to consider when you're getting ready to list your property. I'm going to keep it really simple here. Buyers buy based on emotion. If you're selling a home that's empty, cluttered, or disorganized, you're not going to get top dollar. In a market where buyers are hyper critical about the product they're buying and looking for reasons why they shouldn't buy, your home needs to look cherry.

**2\. Price it right.** Buyers are looking to pay below market value for a home right now, not market value. That's the truth, ladies and gentlemen. The bottom line is that last year, buyers were paying above market value to get a property. They want it. And now that the interest rates have gone up a little bit, now that the market has changed a little bit, buyers are not looking to pay market value. They want to get a better deal. And they want to get a better deal because the narrative is that the prices may continue to decline, and so they're trying to get ahead of it, so pricing is critical.

**3\. Buckle up for a bumpy ride.** Selling your home is going to be a massive disruption. If your agent tells you that this is going to be smooth and easy, they're not being fully honest with you. Now, there are things that we can do to make the process of selling as smooth as possible. But the bottom line is it's going to be a massive disruption in your life, so buckle up.

**4\. Use the right agent.** your listing agent actually matters more than you think. In the last year and a half, you put a property up on the market, and you put up a for sale sign, and you put it on the Internet. The market did all the heavy lifting. Well, that strong market created a lot of weak agents with a lot of bad habits. Now that the market has shifted, you want to work with an agent who understands the shift and how that shift is going to be used to your advantage. It makes a really big difference. It's not about getting the word out about your home being on the market. It's about collecting offers, analyzing those offers, responding to those offers, negotiating aggressively on your behalf, and then facilitating a close because the deal doesn't matter until the deal is closed.

**5\. You’ll make up a loss when you buy.** 65% of sellers actually have to be a buyer. So if you do have to take a little bit of a haircut on your sale because the market has changed a little bit, every area is different. Not every area is flattening out or going down. But the bottom line is, if you do have to take a little bit of a haircut on your sale, you're going to be able to make it up on your buy because most of our sellers become buyers.

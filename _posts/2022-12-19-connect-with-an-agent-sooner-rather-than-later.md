Today I want to talk to all the motivated buyers and sellers about talking to a real estate agent, even before you're ready to actually buy or sell. You should get connected to a real estate agent sooner rather than later. Why? **Having time on your side gives you the ability to strategize.**

I recently visited my friend, and he told me that he’s going to buy in the next six to 12 months. The first thing I said was, “Have you connected with an agent, talked to a lender, and made a plan?” He said he hadn’t because the last time he told an agent that he wanted to buy in the near future, they wouldn't leave him alone, so he just started ignoring them.

Although I understand that mindset of wanting to wait, the bottom line is that **if you connect with an agent, you have lots of time to put a foolproof plan together** so you can get exactly what you want in the amount of time you want to get it. This also means that the price and terms will be favorable because you actually had time to prepare.&nbsp;

I highly recommend finding a great real estate agent that you can trust. Be honest with them and tell them that you’re contacting them now to come up with a plan of attack and that you don’t want to constantly get emails from them. Let them know what your goals are, and work with your agent to come up with a plan so you can win.

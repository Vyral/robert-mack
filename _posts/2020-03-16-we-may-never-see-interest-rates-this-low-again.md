<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Interest rates are lower than I ever thought they would be. Here’s what that means for you.</em></p>

The buzz around town right now has to do with interest rates and how low they are. **We are currently locking in our clients with rates between 3% and 3.5% for 30-year fixed mortgages and under 3% for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages.**

I’m not saying that just because rates are so low you need to make a move, but it’s important to think about how you can leverage these rates to increase the quality of your life. It doesn’t always make sense to buy or refinance, but it would be careless to not consider how you could leverage rates this low.

**There are a few different options.** You might live in a home that you already love and have no intentions of moving from, but you can still talk to a lender about what a refinance could save you in the long term. If you could save a few hundred dollars per month, you want to strike while the iron is hot.

Another option you have is leveraging these low rates to buy your first home—or a better home. People move for all different kinds of reasons, and if you’re looking to buy something that better fits your needs, see if it’s going to work out for you. If it was easy, everyone would be doing it. Sometimes, short-term pain will give you long term pleasure. Spending a week talking to a lender could result in you qualifying for a better mortgage and a lower monthly payment.

Don’t miss out on this opportunity. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.

Let me ask you something: Are you leaving money on the table?

Allow me to explain what I mean. For sellers, consider whether you’re truly getting the most out of your listing. On the buyers’ side of things, think about whether the price you’re paying for a home is fair.

I’ve seen a lot of homes sell for more than they should, lately. However, I’ve also seen homes sell for far less than they could have. One reason for this is Realtor mismanagement.

Now, I would like to share some information about the processes of buying and selling a home. Hopefully this insight will help to put everything into perspective for you.&nbsp;

There are three parts to each of these processes, and I’d like to go over each of these steps within both processes for you today. **Let’s start with the three steps of buying a home:**

1. Find the right home.
2. Negotiate the contract.
3. Think about what comes next.

**As for sellers, the three steps of listing are:**

1. Find the right buyer.
2. Negotiate the contract.
3. Think about what comes next.

You probably noticed that each of these processes, on a basic level, are very similar. Another similarity between these processes is the importance of having a strong Realtor by your side. However, many people in today’s hot market wonder whether it’s worth spending the extra money on one Realtor when another might do the job for half the cost.

Helping someone find a home is easy. And, in a hot market, it’s also easy to help someone find a buyer. If you put a home on the market, list it online, and price it fairly, you’re going to get offers. The true challenge is finding an agent who will guide you every step of the way. **The right agent will not only help you to buy or sell a home, they will also help you put (or keep) more money in your pocket** at the end of the transaction. If you’re buying a home, you need to work with an agent who can negotiate the best price.

All of these are the considerations you must keep in mind when choosing an agent. Find an agent to work with who you know, like, and trust. Beyond that, find someone who will help you maximize your success. The right agent will keep you informed and continue to provide you with value even after your transaction is complete. **Are you looking for an agent who is truly there to help, or are you looking for one who will disappear after closing?** The choice is yours.

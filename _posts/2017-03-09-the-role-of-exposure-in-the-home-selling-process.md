If you’re interested in selling your home in the very near future, **exposure is critical**. I want to share a quick story with you to explain why.&nbsp;

Once upon a time, I was referred to a wonderful prospect in Laguna Beach. Keep in mind, my office is based out of Irvine. I met with this woman and shared my entire marketing plan and selling strategy for her home. Everything seemed like it was working out perfectly.&nbsp;

A few days later, however, she called me to tell me she would no longer do business with me. As it turns out, she heard from a friend that she’d be better off using a local Laguna Beach agent instead of me because they offered her the chance to sell her property off-market.

This kind of thing happens sometimes, and I respected her decision and wished her all the best. But if she was having these thoughts, maybe other people out there were having them too.&nbsp;

That brings me to my message for today. When you’re going through the home buying process and looking for a great listing agent, the decision shouldn’t automatically fall on whoever is the most local. **You want to find the person who will expose your home to the most amount of qualified buyers.** When you’re selling a home, there are many factors that go into the process, but exposure is critical.

Real estate is no longer local—it’s global. People are relocating from all over the world to live in our beautiful area. While I can see where this person was coming from about wanting a local Realtor who might have buyers looking for her home, I also wonder why her other agent would want to limit her property to only local buyers when somebody outside the area was probably going to buy the property anyway.&nbsp;

If you’re a seller, interview whoever you think you need to, but focus on who will expose your home to the highest number of qualified and motivated buyers. The more people that know about your home, the more activity your home sale will generate. More activity means a higher chance of multiple offers. At that point, you won’t leave any money on the table. As a seller, I assume that’s what you ultimately want.

If you have a specific question for me, give me a call or send me an email and I’d be happy to discuss anything you want to talk about. As always, if you have any video ideas you’d like me to expand upon in the future, send them my way. Until then, happy selling\!&nbsp;

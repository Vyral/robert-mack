Today, I want to pose an important question: What is your timeline?

My marketing team and I have been conducting some research recently, and we’ve found that there are three primary stages in the real estate timeline that buyers tend to follow as they prepare to make a home purchase. Let’s take a look at each of these stages.

**1\. &nbsp;Awareness.** We’ve found that people in this stage tend to be between 18 to 24 years old. This is the stage where a person may have considered the notion of buying a home but haven’t really gotten serious about doing so. People often become very comfortable with where they’re at in life. Sometimes, they become too comfortable. In order to move past the awareness stage, you must be proactive.

**2\. &nbsp;Interest.** Buyers at this stage in their home purchase timeline have become more actively engaged with their home search. They are beginning to look more frequently at online listings, and they may be consuming other media related to the real estate process as a means of preparation. At this point, buyers are typically eight to 12 months away from actually moving forward with a home purchase.

**3\. &nbsp;Decision.** This final stage in the real estate timeline is the point when buyers are calling Realtors and setting up appointments. Buyers in the decision stage are typically three to six months out from making their home purchase. It is at this stage that people become truly serious about finding a property.

With all that in mind, remember that a home purchase is a major decision—it takes time. Most of the clients my team and I work with spend several months working their way through the process.

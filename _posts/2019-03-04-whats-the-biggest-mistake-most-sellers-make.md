When it comes to selling a home, there is one major mistake most people make. What is this mistake? It’s simple: **Most people fail to prepare their homes for the market before they list.** Every single seller I’ve spoken to wants to maximize their equity and sell for top dollar, but their actions aren’t consistent with their goals. Very rarely do these same sellers follow through by adequately preparing their property.

Buyers will offer higher prices when they have an emotional connection to a property, and these emotional connections don’t happen by mistake. It takes a well-staged, decluttered, and depersonalized home to capture the attention of potential buyers in our market. They fall in love with the space because they can imagine themselves living in it.

If you haven’t prepared your home ahead of time, it’s pretty unlikely this will happen.

**The good news is that preparing a home for the market doesn’t mean you have to do a complete rehaul of every single room.** All it takes is some strategic adjustments.

Making minor repairs, giving the walls a fresh, neutral coat of paint, and thoroughly cleaning each room will make a massive impact on your success. Each of these things will boost your chance of earning top dollar, while simultaneously ensuring that buyers will have a strong first impression when they step foot in your home.

And if you go the extra mile by hiring a professional stager, you’ll be in an even better position. **Stagers know what it takes to present a home in its best light.**

Homes that are staged and feel move-in ready also sell more quickly than homes that aren’t. So, in short, the time it takes to prepare a property is well worth it when you consider the results these preparations will bring.

If you want top dollar, don’t make this major mistake. Make sure you prepare your home before you list.

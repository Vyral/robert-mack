Here’s what kind of seller you need to be to sell for top dollar.

What kind of seller are you? I’ve been selling real estate for 15 years, and in that time, I’ve dissected many types of clients.&nbsp;

**I’ve found that there are three types of sellers:**

1. The seller who wants to do nothing to their home except list it.&nbsp;
2. The seller who wants to do everything to their home before listing it.
3. The seller who’s willing to keep an open mind and make minor repairs and modifications to their home so it shows as a high-quality product and maximizes their ROI.

If you haven’t figured it out by now, I’m a big fan of the last type. In other words, I’m a big fan of considering minor repairs and design modifications to make your home look and feel more expensive than it is and make buyers comfortable about submitting their highest offer. As a seller, it’s important to understand that **fewer than 5% of all homes are ready to sell right away.** Most people have to do something to make their homes show better.&nbsp;

In my world, buyers buy based on perceived value. They’ll make an offer based on emotion, then justify it based on logic. Oftentimes, with just a small investment, you can make your home look $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, or even $100,000 more expensive. By “small investment,” I mean typically as little as $5,000 to $10,000.&nbsp;

As I’ve said many times before: Real estate is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Sellers who aren’t willing to make upgrades or enhancements before selling are potentially leaving money on the table. Similarly, sellers who want to upgrade everything are also potentially leaving money on the table.&nbsp;

**Sellers who keep an open mind and consider making small repairs, though, are the ones who win.** This could mean repainting the interior, steam cleaning the carpets, getting the home professionally staged, etc. Statistically, staged homes sell for 5% to 6% more and 75% quicker than unstaged homes.&nbsp;

So, figure out where you stand as a seller. Do you want to make a ton of upgrades, no upgrades at all, or work with a real estate expert who knows exactly what buyers are looking for so you can maximize your ROI? That’s exactly what my team and I specialize in: Helping people invest a minimal amount of money to gain a maximum amount of net proceeds.&nbsp;

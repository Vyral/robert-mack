Do you like cake? So do I. Today I want to talk about why lenders are just like cake.

Let’s say you’re getting ready to get married and you’ve decided that the wedding cake has to be red velvet. You go to the cake shop, and the baker asks you to try the carrot cake and white chocolate cake before buying the red velvet cake. Would you try them? Of course you would. Cake is delicious, and **you’re just exploring your options**. You might like one of them better than red velvet, and you might not. At least you’ll know.

This is exactly how choosing a lender should work. A lot of buyers come to us with a lender they have in mind. That’s great; we respect your decision and don’t want to derail you, but we do want you to explore your options. What if we refer you to a lender that has better rates and communication? If you don’t like them, you can still work with the original lender you had in mind.

We don’t care what kind of cake you have at your wedding, and we don’t care which lender you use. **We just want you to be happy when you're working with us.&nbsp;**

If you have any questions about exploring your options in real estate or concerning the market in general, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

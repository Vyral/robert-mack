Is it worth it to work with Redfin?

It’s not just about finding the right home. Finding a home is the easy part. Anyone can go to Redfin or Zillow or get listings from a Realtor and find their own home.&nbsp;

**The challenge is in writing up the offer.** That’s when you really need someone who has experience and is really going to be an advocate for you. Their job is to help you find the best lender and craft an offer that will get you the best price and the best terms. They will even help you find the best home inspector so you can be sure you really know what you’re buying.&nbsp;

There is so much that goes into the escrow process. In my industry, anybody who offers large credits is considered to be a discount brokerage. When you work with a discount brokerage, there is going to be a level of discount service that comes with it. There are going to be areas that you will need to fill, or gaps in the process. So is it worth your time and potential gaps to receive that rebate?&nbsp;

**My team and I don’t compete on price—we compete on service.** For example, when you go to Nordstrom, you’ll have a professional helping you find that perfect outfit. When you go to Nordstrom’s Rack, you might get a great outfit, but you’re going to have to work for it. You’ll have to dig through clothes and compete for the attention of someone to help you. You’re going to earn that outfit, just like you’ll earn those Redfin savings.&nbsp;

**You’re busy with work and your family, so you need to decide if you really want to micromanage the entire process.** If you’re thinking about using Redfin or another alternative option, I’d love to sit down with you and go over what my team and I could do for you.&nbsp;

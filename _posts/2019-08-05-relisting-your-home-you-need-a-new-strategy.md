So you tried listing your home but failed to sell it.

If you still want to get it sold, what do you do? Perhaps you thought you were working with a great agent the first time around, but it still didn’t work out, and now you’re getting a hundred phone calls from other agents inquiring about your home. Where were these agents when your home was on the market? Why do they want your listing now?

This might be confusing, but you need to understand that when a home doesn’t sell, one of two things must happen: **You either need to change the price dramatically or change the product dramatically.&nbsp;**

By changing the product, I mean changing how the home shows. If your home already shows well, then your price was probably too high. If you priced your home fairly, perhaps it doesn’t look the way it should.&nbsp;

As we know, the folk definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. You wouldn’t believe how many homeowners I’ve seen either relist their homes with the same agent after failing once already or relist with a different agent who does the same thing their old agent did.&nbsp;

This won’t get you the results you want when you relist. **You need to work with a new agent who knows how to get the job done, whether this means changing the price, product, or marketing.&nbsp;**

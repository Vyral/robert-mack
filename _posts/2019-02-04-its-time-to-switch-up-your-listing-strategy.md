Have you ever tried and failed to sell a home? Whether the listing simply expired or you had to cancel it for one reason or another, this can be a very disappointing experience. If this sounds familiar, let me ask you an important question: **Is it time for a change?**

Before I cover a few of the tactics you can use to get back on your feet after a failed listing experience, allow me to say that sometimes the inciting circumstances are out of anyone’s control.&nbsp;

However, **between 50% to 60% of the time, the reason a home failed to sell was that either the seller or their agent did not rise to the occasion.** If this was the case, don’t let it stop you from trying again. Just make sure that you try a different approach. Sometimes, the best solution is to hire a different agent. Choosing not to relist in a declining market, like the one we’re in now, means you’re just bleeding money.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give my team and I a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

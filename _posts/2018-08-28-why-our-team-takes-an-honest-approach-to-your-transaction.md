You’ve probably heard the saying “The customer is always right,” but is this saying true in real estate? Are buyers and sellers always “right?”

Oftentimes when I speak to buyers or sellers, it becomes apparent that they’re operating within an assumption of how their transaction “should” go, instead of basing their strategy on how the deal is actually playing out.

Especially with our market beginning to shift, it’s important that buyers and sellers do away with this mindset. People give too much thought to what they see on social media or in articles online. **My team and I deal with many different clients on a daily basis, so our perspective is one you can trust.**

We are always honest with our clients, even it if means not always being on the same page. Our goal is to be realistic and to help our clients become successful in their real estate goals as a result.

**If you’re working with a Realtor who only ever tells you “yes,” this is a major red flag.** If a seller comes to us and wants to sell for $900,000 but market conditions don’t support that figure, I will guide them toward a more feasible price.

Of course I want my clients to earn the best deal possible; however, unlike certain sycophantic agents, I know that succeeding in this market will require a more pragmatic approach. I want my clients to not only win in the market, but to also understand what’s going on.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

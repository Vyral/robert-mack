<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Now is a great time to sell, and these are the four main reasons why.</em></p>

Now is one of the best times to sell a home that I’ve ever seen. However, this doesn’t apply to everyone. My team and I specialize in helping people sell homes when unforeseen life circumstances arise. It may not be the right time for you personally to sell, for various reasons.&nbsp;

Nevertheless, if you’ve been considering or need to sell, today’s housing market presents an incredible opportunity. Here are the top four reasons that right now is the best time to sell:

**1\. Inventory is exceptionally low.** To put this into perspective, last year at this time Orange County as a whole had 7,500 houses available for sale, and even then we were still in a low inventory season. Today, Orange County has fewer than 5,000 houses available for sale. Inventory is about 30% to 35% lower compared to this time in 2019. If you thought it was slim pickings then, now we’re in a whole other ballgame.&nbsp;

**2\. Interest rates are historically low.** When we look at the strongest seller’s markets from the past 20 years, 2001 to 2005 was the best period, where interest rates were hovering around 5% to 6%. Today, rates are in the high twos and low threes. Even though that earlier market was appreciating, buyers are more excited to buy now.&nbsp;

**3\. Buyer demand and confidence are through the roof.** Buyers feel good about purchasing properties right now; they feel it’s a great life decision and investment.&nbsp;

**4\. There’s no end in sight.** Many of my current clients are asking if prices are going to fall, but everything we see right now indicates this will continue for a while. Someday prices will decrease; the real estate market is cyclical. However, we don’t expect prices to drop for another 18 to 24 months, maybe even longer.&nbsp;

If you’re considering selling, you have very little competition, buyers want to buy, and interest rates are so low it’s almost free to borrow money. All this is a recipe for success.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking about selling, reach out, and **let us know how we can help.** The real estate agent you hire matters. Just because it’s a strong seller’s market doesn’t mean you don’t need a professional’s help. Strategy is still required for you to sell in the right amount of time for top dollar.

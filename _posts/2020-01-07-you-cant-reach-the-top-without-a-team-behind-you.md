<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Whether you’re a buyer or seller, you need a team to help you achieve your real estate goals.</em></p>

How will a team help you get to the top?

Before I answer that question, allow me to share a quick story. In March 2018, one of my extended team members—my business coach—told me he wanted to climb Mount Aconcagua, the tallest peak in South America, later that December and wanted to know if I’d come along. I’d always been an avid outdoorsman and loved camping, but I’d never heard of Mount Aconcagua, so I told him I’d have to learn more about it first.&nbsp;

After doing a little research, I learned that climbing Mount Aconcagua would be a 14-day expedition. That’s when I thought, “There’s no way I can do this.” I couldn’t just disconnect from my life for 14 days. Then, he told me that it would actually last 20 days.&nbsp;

Long story short, I did it, and the reason why was the team that was assembled to guide us on the expedition. **There’s an important lesson here that applies to buying or selling a home.&nbsp;**

To put this into perspective, you can see a picture of me and three of my friends at 1:45 in the video hiking from camp one to camp two on the mountain. This was around day nine, and it gives you a good idea of how extreme the situation was. You might look at this photo and think, “Wow, what an epic picture,” but what you don’t see is the 30 others that helped my team and me get to that point. We had three expert guides assigned to us to make sure we got to the top, but we didn’t know there would also be many others who were in charge of making sure we had an amazing experience.&nbsp;

From the medical team to the porters to the mules to the kitchen staff, we had so many people helping us get to the top, and we wouldn’t have been able to get that photo without them.&nbsp;

Buying a home can be a scary decision, but it’s also very exciting. However, **if you don’t have the right team on your side, you won’t get from where you are to where you want to be.** You also won’t have a good experience. The same goes for sellers, whether you’re liquidating your assets or transitioning into a bigger home.&nbsp;

No matter what, these are big mountains to climb, and it’s important to understand that 90% of all agents in Orange County are solo agents. They do everything themselves. Could I have climbed Mount Aconcagua with just one other person? It’s not impossible, but most people get to the top because they have a team of trained professionals helping them every step of the way.&nbsp;

I don’t think I could’ve made it to the top with just one other person; the team is what helped me. There is a lot that goes into buying or selling a home, so you want to work with an agent who has a staff dedicated to making sure the experience is efficient, pleasurable, and successful. You also need a team that works with extended team members like title and escrow officers, handymen, contractors, etc.&nbsp;

So if you’re thinking of buying or selling in Orange County and you want to know how my team and I can help you get to the top, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. We’d love to work with you.

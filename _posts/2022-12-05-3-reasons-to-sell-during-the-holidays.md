Sellers, should you list your home during the holiday season? Many homeowners think that it's a bad time to list, but it’s actually quite the opposite. Here are three reasons why it might be a great time to sell your home during the holiday season:&nbsp;

**1\. Less competition.** The narrative says it's not a good time to sell during the holidays, so many sellers are taking their homes off the market or waiting until the new year to put them on the market. That means less competition now and more competition in the new year if you wait.

**2\. Motivated buyers.** Only motivated buyers are looking to buy a home during the holiday season. If they weren't motivated, they'd be spending time with friends and family, traveling, and doing holiday stuff. If they're looking now, there might be a need to buy before the end of the year, and your home might be the perfect fit.

**3\. Affordability is up.** Rates shot up into the mid-7% range recently. With a 3-1 buydown, you can get your rate starting as low as 3.5% with creative financing and aggressive lending guidelines. Buyers can afford more home now than even just one month ago.

If you're a seller with strong motivation, now may be a perfect time for you to sell. If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out to me by phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you.

A couple of months ago, my mentor said something to me that really reflects what’s happening in our market: Change creates uncertainty, uncertainty creates doubt, doubt creates fear, and fear creates paralysis.

And **with as much as our market has evolved recently, many buyers have definitely found themselves in a state of paralysis.**

It is the buyers who have partnered with an experienced Realtor who are in the best position to find success. While a large portion of today’s buyers are afraid to pull the trigger, those who have professional guidance are sure to find and secure a fair deal.&nbsp;

The old adage is true: Knowledge is power. **Buyers today must understand what they can qualify for, what kind of monthly payment they’re comfortable with, and what’s motivating them to buy in the first place.**

Thankfully, the recent changes in our market actually pose a great benefit to buyers. We’re now seeing higher levels of inventory, with fewer multiple offer situations as a result. Beyond that, homes are also spending longer on the market. This gives buyers more time to think through their purchase before making a move.

Nevertheless, **it’s still important for buyers to be prepared to pull the trigger when the time is right.** Educated and well-prepared buyers who are working with the right agent will find that success is well within reach in today’s market.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

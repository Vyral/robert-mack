A couple of weeks ago, I had a property listed for a pretty attractive (but fair) price. We had it staged, it looked beautiful, and it was a hot home on Redfin. We knew that we were going to get multiple offers for it. When we held the open house, about 100 people came through on the first day. One person in particular stood out to me.

**This gentleman walked right up to me, got in my face, and asked how much commission I was offering.** I wasn’t sure why that was relevant since it was an open house, not an excuse to get into an argument about the commission. I told him I wasn’t willing to discuss that right then, but he told me that he asked because he was already working with an agent but was willing to drop that agent to work directly with me if he could get a good deal.

That’s where I drew the line. I told him that he wasn’t the type of client I was trying to work with. I thought it was disrespectful, and if he was willing to ditch his agent at the drop of a dime just to get a better one, how could I know he wouldn’t do the same to me?

**I’m not looking to work with clients who aren’t loyal.** The people I like to work with are those who trust me and are committed to working with me and my team. I like people who are honest, transparent, and allow me to use my expertise to help them get what they want. I consider myself an expert, and the advice I give is extremely valuable.

On the other hand, if I had only been in the industry for a few years, I might be excited to have a conversation like that. Back then, I was selling only a few homes a year just trying to make a living. Any deal from any area would’ve been valuable to me. However, **I’ve been doing this for 16 years now**, and I have a very strong book of business; we have many different lead generation sources that help us meet more people and create more visibility. We end up working with some amazing people.

If you’re a consumer, it’s important to know who you’re talking to when you approach an agent. Are you talking to someone who has only been in the business for a short while or someone who has been in it for decades? In the end, the way that the gentleman approached me was just not the right way to communicate with someone who has been doing this for as long as I have.

Though the type of market we’re in today is highly aggressive, **people are still managing to buy the homes they love** and take advantage of the appreciation. However, the buying process can be challenging, especially if you’re not working with an expert and just going to open houses to wheel and deal. If you want to set yourself up for success in this market, align yourself with a real estate expert who understands what you’re looking for and can help you through the process from beginning to end. Don’t just approach a random agent to ask for a deal.

If you’re thinking about buying a home and would like professional assistance, or if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me. I’d love to help you get the ball rolling.

Chief economists have recently reported that 175,000 fewer jobs were created this year than what was projected. In other words, the economy is not in as good a position as you might think. This development does bring some good news, though. Namely, **interest rates are expected to soon reach figures never before seen in real estate history.** And low rates mean a high level of opportunity for homebuyers. Even a small change in interest rates can greatly impact affordability.

Low interest rates mean great things for sellers, as well. Although there still isn’t a lot of inventory, throngs of buyers have been incentivized to make a move as a result of these low rates. In other words, **demand has shot up despite the current lack of supply.** However, this might not continue to be the case if supply grows significantly over the next few months. We will see a shift in the market eventually, whether it comes in six, 12, or 18 months. And when this shift occurs, prices will likely flatten out.&nbsp;

So could you potentially buy a home for less money if you waited a year to make a move? Maybe. But keep in mind that rates might be higher at that point. **If interest rates rise even by 1%, your buying power will drop 10%.** So even if you buy a home for less, your monthly payment will be more.

With all of this in mind, the first step you should take when you’re considering buying is to speak with a lender. If you can qualify to buy now, I believe you’ll get a better rate today than you would 12 months from now.

The bottom line of today’s message is this: When rates are low, it’s a great time to buy or sell.

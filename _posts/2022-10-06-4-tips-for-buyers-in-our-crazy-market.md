It’s not always a great time to buy for everyone, but if it’s the right time for you, here are four ways to set yourself up for success:

1. **Figure out your motivation.** Do you have a need to buy? You might be moving up or moving down. You could be an empty-nester or facing a job relocation. Are you truly motivated?

1. **Educate yourself.** Do you know enough about becoming a successful buyer? You need to speak to a real estate agent to understand the real estate process. Consult a lender about your loan options.

1. **Save up the necessary funds.** Do you have enough for a down payment? You need a steady income and a stable job to afford a new home payment.

1. **Create a strategy.** Whether you are looking to purchase in one month or one year, it’s never too early to sit down and put a strategy together. Remember: If you fail to plan, you plan to fail.

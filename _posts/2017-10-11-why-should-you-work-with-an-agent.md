Do you even want a Realtor?

The reality is that if you’re looking to buy a property, you have two options: you can try to take care of everything on your own and interact with the listing agent without representation, or you can do some research and choose a buyer’s agent who’s right for you.&nbsp;

Either way, you’re going to be working with a Realtor. Why not work with one whose job is to represent you? **99% of homes that sell are sold through Realtors, and there’s a reason for that.**

Although, what I’ve learned throughout my years of experience is that if buyers could work without agents, they probably would. Most consumers don’t really want to deal with it. Some may not think that there’s such a thing as a good Realtor.

Today, I want to change your mind and let you know that there are so many good Realtors out there. Buying a home is a big decision with a lot of emotional and financial commitments involved. Trying to undergo the process alone simply isn’t the best route to take. After all, the job of an agent is to make things easier for you.

**When choosing a Realtor, remember that you should always work with someone who can help navigate you through the process.** The right Realtor will have a great relationship with lenders, as well.&nbsp;

If you’re looking to buy a home, why not work with someone who has your best interests in mind instead of defaulting to the listing agent? A buyer’s agent will help you put together a strategy and walk you through the whole transaction. Every step should be made simple and clear with the help of a quality professional.&nbsp;

The alternative is spending a lot of time and effort calling around to different agents, not making any decisions, and ultimately making things a lot more complicated. If you do that, you’ll have 20 different agents all calling and asking if you’re ready to work with them. Why put yourself through the trouble?

If you’re just calling different agents throughout the process without committing to a single Realtor, you don’t have the benefit of working with someone who knows and understands you and your needs. Bouncing from agent to agent means never having the opinion of someone who has seen every step of your transaction.&nbsp;

Also, **when you work with the listing agent you need to realize that they were hired by the seller to get the most money for the property possible.** That being the case, they aren’t looking out for your needs.&nbsp;

A lot has changed in the market and it’s always important to have an advocate on your side who you know and trust. Buying a home is a team effort. Without a Realtor the process will be overwhelming and inefficient.

Before choosing a Realtor, meet with a few professionals to determine who would be the best for you.&nbsp;

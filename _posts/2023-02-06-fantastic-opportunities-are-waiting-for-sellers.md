If you’re thinking of selling but are under the impression that it’s not the right time, here are a few things you should consider:

**1\. Buyers are out in full force.** The spring season is upon us. Historically, February, March, and April are very active buying seasons, and we're seeing that this year.&nbsp;

**2\. Rates are settling around 5%.** Also, lenders have a few things up their sleeves, so we're starting to see buyers become more comfortable with where interest rates are now. Plus, there are different types of loan programs out there that are helping them get affordable monthly payments.&nbsp;

**3\. Inventory is still low.** Inventory has grown since January, but it's still significantly lower than it was in 2019 when we were in a normal seller's market. The great news is that buyer confidence is growing. We don’t see over 30 offers on a property anymore, but houses that are properly prepared to sell, priced correctly, and have an agent who did a great job exposing it to buyers are getting between two to six offers.

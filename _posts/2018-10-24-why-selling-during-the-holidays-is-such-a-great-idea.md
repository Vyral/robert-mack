Around this time of year, many home sellers may decide to remove their home from the market until the new year because they’re under the impression that the holidays are a bad time to sell.

However, as a professional Realtor, I can confidently say that this isn’t really the case for our local market right now. Waiting until the new year may traditionally earn you more money, but we’re currently in an appreciating market where the inverse may be true.&nbsp;

<br>I’ve written in the past on this subject before, when I compiled a list of the top nine reasons to list during the holidays, and I’d like to return to this topic today. If you’d like a copy of my past article on the subject, I’d be happy to send one to you, but for now I’ll be sharing just three main points:

**1\. Buyers are more motivated during the holidays.** It may be true that fewer buyers are on the market during this time of year, but the ones who are out and looking will be much more driven. After all, people choosing to spend their holidays searching for a new home are obviously doing so for a good reason.

**2\. There’s less competition.** Along with there being fewer buyers on the market over the holidays, there are also fewer listings. This gives you the perfect chance to make your home stand out.

**3\. Inventory dramatically rises after the holidays.** All of the sellers who waited until after the holidays to list will be flooding the market at the beginning of the new year. Listing before this happens, therefore, is a surefire way to capture the interest of motivated buyers while competition is low.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

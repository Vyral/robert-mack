If you’re a homeowner, should you adapt Wendy’s or Mastro’s strategy when selling your property?

At Mastro’s, presentation is a priority. From the food preparation to service to plating, it’s all about creating the best possible experience for the customer. Wendy’s on the other hand, is mostly concerned about serving their customers the fastest and easiest way. So which team are you? Do you focus on the presentation of your home like Mastro’s does with their food servings, or are you more like Wendy’s who piles food on their trays and leaves it at that?&nbsp;

Unfortunately, a lot of sellers right now are using Wendy’s strategy. It worked great in a strong seller’s market, but **now that the market has shifted, buyers are pickier, and homes are taking longer to sell.** It’s more important than ever that sellers adapt Mastro’s approach and focus more on presentation if they want to get top dollar.&nbsp;

Think about something you’ve been wanting to do for a very long time. Are you blocked? I’ve been making videos for 10 years now, so I’ve gotten very comfortable with it. But when I started, I over-thought the process to no end. Do I have the right camera, does my hair look good, should I change my shirt?&nbsp;

**A lot of us wait for things to be perfect before we take action.** However, it won’t be perfect most of the time, so many of us just don’t take action. That is the sad truth.

When it comes to real estate, everyone always wants it to be perfect. It’s not the perfect time to buy, so I’m going to stay out of the market. In reality, when’s the last time something was perfect?&nbsp;

**One of my mentors always reminds me that done is better than perfect.** The more you do something, the better you’ll get at it, but it’ll still never be perfect. Are my videos perfect today? Absolutely not, but I stopped caring as much because it’s the content that matters at the end of the day.

Are you the type of buyer or seller who’s waiting for the perfect time? Truthfully, it’s probably never going to be perfect, but **you should still consider your options.&nbsp;**

My team and I rarely work with people who have the perfect scenario. However, we hear from people all the time who wish they had bought a home three years ago when we told them to. Whatever the reason, too many people wait for the perfect time and get nothing done because of it.

If you know someone who might value this video, send it to them. If you’re looking to buy or sell, my team and I would love the opportunity to serve you. Also, if you have any ideas for future videos, send those my way as well.

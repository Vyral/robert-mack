**If you’ve tried to sell your home in the past and the sale was unsuccessful, this message is for you.** It’s not for homeowners who canceled their listing because of personal reasons.

If you follow my blog, you know that I’ve said that pricing plus preparation plus exposure equals a record-price sale. If you've tried to sell in the past and failed, here’s what I want you to do: I want you to audit your experience. **First, think about the price that you set for your property.** Was it fair? Was it based on your current competition and what they were selling for?

**If your price was fine and you still didn’t sell, maybe you didn’t prepare your home well enough to sell.** When we take a listing, our goal is to put out the highest quality product. In a perfect world, we’d stage every home to attract buyers and make them fall in love, but we can’t always do that. You have to do what you can within your resources to put out the highest quality product.

When you previously listed your home, was it clean? Was it decluttered? That’s another missing link that can turn buyers off even if the price is right.

**The final missing link is the exposure that your property had.** Maybe you hired an inexperienced agent who didn’t have a strategy in place to sell your property.

**If your home came off the market, but you still want to sell it, you have to ask yourself what was the missing link: pricing, condition, or your agent?**

If the agent was your problem, it’s time to find a new agent who can help you achieve your goals of selling for a record price. Our team specializes in selling homes like these so if you or someone you know is thinking about relisting any time in the near future, don't hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

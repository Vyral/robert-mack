Now that we are in the new year, I’ve been getting a lot of questions from people who want to sell their homes for top dollar. They are asking me when the best time to list is in order to maximize their home sale and leave no stone left unturned.

**Many homeowners and consumers in general believe selling a home in spring or summer will result in the highest amount of money on the sale.** That’s actually not the case. Spring and summer are great times to buy because inventory dramatically rises.&nbsp;

When inventory levels rise, buyers have more choices. With more choices comes more competition for your home. When there is high competition, demand will fall. This means homes won’t sell for the prices that most homeowners want because there are too many options out there.&nbsp;

**We are advising all our clients to put their homes on the market in January, February, or March because that’s when inventory levels are low.** When inventory is low, there are more buyer eyeballs on your property. When there is less competition and more buyers and the demand is higher, you will be able to sell for the most amount of money and not leave anything on the table. This isn’t always the case for everyone, but we are finding that this is the time when you can net the most amount of money.

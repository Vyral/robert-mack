Homeowners who decide to list their property don’t always succeed.

Whether the listing expired or the homeowner cancelled it themselves, some sellers decide against putting their property back on the market. On the other hand, **35% of unsuccessful sellers will relist their property within a two- to three-month period.**

As a Realtor, one of the things I do on a daily basis is to reach out to the sellers who decide against relisting. It’s part of my job to seek feedback from these people about where their sale went wrong and what’s preventing them from trying again.

There are many reasons why a listing may fail, but a majority of the sellers I speak to cite the same thing when asked about why their sale fell flat. **These sellers tell me that the agent they worked with did an inadequate job.**

I’m blown away by the number of sellers I hear from who hired the first agent they spoke to. This is a recipe for disaster, and one that no seller should ever repeat.

So **if you’ve ever been through the disappointment of an unsuccessful listing experience, don’t make the same mistake twice.** When it comes time to re-list, interview multiple agents.

Not all Realtors are the same. In fact, the majority of agents just wing it. They don’t treat our business like a business. As a seller, you deserve better. The only way to be successful is to work with someone who knows what they’re doing and who cares about your goals.

The right agent will have the experience, knowledge, systems, and tools necessary to get your property sold quickly and for top dollar. Don’t settle for less.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

If you’re a home seller or a homeowner who is curious about selling, there is no better time to sell than now. Here’s why.

Our current market is that we are currently in is one of the strongest seller's markets I’ve ever experienced. The inventory is still very low, interest rates are still low, and there are way more buyers than there are homes for sale. **This all may change in the next six months to a year, but homes are selling for a premium right now.**

The best advice I can give a homeowner who is thinking about selling their home is to interview a few different agents before you pull the trigger, so you can get a few different perspectives. **Every agent is a little bit different, and each has a different way of handling the transaction.**

What a home is currently worth in the market right now is not necessarily what we could sell it for. **With the right marketing and pricing strategies, you can squeeze out even more money than you think.** A lot of homes that we’ve been listing have been selling for above market value because of our strategy.

If you’re thinking about selling your home or know someone who is, don't hesitate to reach out and give me a call or send me an email with any questions. I would love to hear from you soon and I’d be happy to answer them.

If you’re looking to sell your home, you know that it’s an emotional process. It’s difficult to look at things rationally and make the best decision by yourself, so today I want to talk about how you can sell your home like a pro with no emotion.&nbsp;

The best thing you can do for your home sale is to treat your property like a product. I get it; you’ve lived in your home for years, and it isn’t just a building to you anymore. It’s full of memories and completely integrated into your life. However, if you want to get top dollar and find a new home to make memories in, you need to let go of these emotions and understand that your property is a product.&nbsp;

In my experience, three factors determine if you’ll get top dollar for your home:&nbsp;

**1\. Preparation.** The properties that sell for the highest and best prices are those that show like model homes. If you can stage your property with a professional designer, the return on your investment will be huge. This is because buyers buy based on emotion. If you can take your own emotions out of the transaction, you can appeal to your buyers’ emotions and get a fantastic deal.

**2\. Price.** This is the bait you use to attract buyers. If you price your home correctly, buyers will want your property because it’s a great deal. However, if you’ve staged it correctly, it should look fantastic. Buyers will be fighting each other tooth and nail to put in the best possible offer for your house.&nbsp;

**3\. Market exposure.** The more buyers see your home, the better. If you can move out of your house before listing, you’ll be in a great position to get as many eyes as possible on your property. This way, buyers can visit your property at all hours of the day.&nbsp;

If you follow these tips, you can sell your home for top dollar in a fantastic market. If you have any questions, please call or email me. I’d love to help you\!

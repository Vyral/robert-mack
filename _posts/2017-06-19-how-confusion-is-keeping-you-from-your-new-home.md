Are you confused?

I’m talking to you, homebuyers. There’s a lot of information online and buyers don’t know where to start. When our clients are confused, they don’t take action. When they have a strategy and know what they want, they do take action.&nbsp;

The market right now in Orange County is moving very fast. **Home prices are on the rise, demand is high, interest rates are predicted to rise, and people want to buy a property while a home is still within their reach.&nbsp;**

This isn’t the market to be confused in because if you are, you won’t take action and you won’t achieve your real estate goals.&nbsp;

So what’s the solution?&nbsp;

**You want to find a Realtor and lender team that you feel comfortable working with.** A lot of buyers work on their own, calling listing agents, checking listing websites, and before they know it, months have gone by and prices and interest rates have risen. So, the best thing you can do is find a Realtor that you know, trust, and can be vulnerable with. Let them know what you want, why you want it, when you want it by, and work with that Realtor to come up with a strategy so you can be in a position to say yes to a home.&nbsp;

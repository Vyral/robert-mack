Today I’m talking to the homeowners out there who either need more or less space than what they currently have in their home. Right now, it’s a fantastic time to consider upgrading or downsizing for a few reasons.

**First, interest rates are now below 4%.** While it’s obvious why this is good for buyers, it’s also good news for sellers. The more buyers that qualify for a home in your price range, the better the chances are of you selling for a great price. More and more buyers are entering the current market, qualifying for more, and having a lower monthly payment. They're actively and aggressively looking for homes.

**Second, inventory for great properties is still really low.** As supply goes up, demand falls. Our supply is still extremely low, so demand is still high. When you combine that with the low interest rates, it’s the perfect time for you to get your home sold for top dollar.

Here’s the kicker and why it makes sense to downsize or upgrade right now: Inventory is going to significantly rise in the next few months. Right now, you can sell your home for a record price, then when you’re ready to buy after that, you’re going to be in a position where you have a lot more options and a lot more control in the transaction. You’re probably going to find a great deal.

**Everyone likes to sell high and buy low and our real estate market is set up perfectly for doing so right now.** If you or someone you know is in a position to make a move, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

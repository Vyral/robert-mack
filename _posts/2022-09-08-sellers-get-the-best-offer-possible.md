Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you know that our housing market is slowing down. Gone are the days when you could list your home and receive 15 offers within a weekend. However, is that a bad thing? The reality is you’ll only accept one offer, so as long as it’s a good one, it doesn’t matter how many others you receive. Here are three things you can do to make sure you get the best offer possible:

**1\. Prep your home.** Show buyers that you care about your house. The more expensive your home looks, the better your final offer will be.&nbsp;

**2\. Price aggressively.** This way, more buyers will visit your home. If you generate more competition, buyers will feel pressured to put in their best offer.

**3\. Don’t sell your home short.** While you have to price aggressively, don’t undersell your house. You may only receive one offer, so make sure buyers know what price you think is acceptable.&nbsp;

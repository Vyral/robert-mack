Are you thinking of buying a home soon? If so, you need to make sure you aren’t walking into a money pit. Today I want to discuss how you can properly inspect a home and know what you’re getting yourself into.&nbsp;

The truth is that a general inspection might not uncover every issue in a home. That’s why **I always recommend these three different home inspections,** depending on the type of property you’re buying:

1. The general inspection
2. A roof inspection&nbsp;
3. A sewer line inspection

In total, these inspections will cost you less than $1,000, but they could save you a ton of money. When you’re buying a property that’s $800,000 or more, that’s a drop in the bucket.

If the general home inspector calls something out, I recommend you check it out further. For example, if they find issues with the plumbing, you should probably hire a plumber and investigate. The bottom line is that there are dozens of potential inspections you might need. **I recommend starting with the three I mentioned and going from there.&nbsp;**

If you found value from this or think someone else might, please send it their way. Also, if you have any video ideas or questions, please call or email me. I am always willing to help\!

Happy New Year\! Now that 2018 is here, I want to talk a little bit about what we’re seeing from the market.&nbsp;

**Prices are still pretty stable, but they are slowly moving up. I think the big thing everyone wants to know, though, is what we can expect this year from inventory.**

Inventory was low throughout 2017. Right now, inventory is still low.&nbsp;

However, I’ve got some good news. **Historically, inventory will rise after Super Bowl Sunday.** There is no guarantee this will happen, but it has definitely been a trend in the past.&nbsp;

Still, you can’t time the market perfectly. Buyers who need to make their move as soon as possible should get in touch with an agent and get started on the process while interest rates and prices are still good.&nbsp;

If you have some time to wait, though, you may want to hold off for a couple of months and see what happens. This is especially true if the area where you’re looking currently has tight inventory.

But what if you are a seller? If that’s the case, **it makes sense for you to list before inventory levels begin to rise.** This way, you’ll be able to avoid the competition that increased inventory will bring.&nbsp;

Savvy sellers are putting their homes on the market sooner rather than later. Any time between now and mid-February presents a good opportunity to beat that inventory rush.&nbsp;

Of course, my team and I would be happy to help you with your specific circumstances. If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

If you’re a home seller, there are two things that you need to keep your focus on: **timing and strategy.** The market has shifted and it should come as no surprise. I’ve been talking about this shift for the last few months and now it is finally here.

**Here’s what we’re seeing right now.** Home inventory is up, demand for properties is down, interest rates are rising, fewer homes are selling, and homes are taking longer to sell. In fact, 40% of the homes that are listed on the market right now will be canceled or expire. **This is why timing is so essential when selling.** Every day, every week, and every month that you wait to list, you’re risking a lower net profit on the sale of your property.

Now that we’ve talked about timing, let’s discuss strategy. In the last six-and-a-half years when the market was aggressively appreciating, you could use the wrong strategy and still sell your home. Even if the photos online weren’t great or the home didn’t show great, it didn’t really matter. Inventory was so low that buyers would buy anything. If your home was overpriced to start, the market would eventually catch up.

**That’s not happening anymore.** The market is very unforgiving right now, which is why I want to talk about three things that could negatively affect you if you use the wrong home-selling strategy:

1\. Your home is going to take much longer to sell than normal, if it even sells at all.<br>2\. You could be potentially leaving tens of thousands of dollars on the table by overpricing from the start and reducing your price over time.<br>3\. Your home will ultimately sell for less money.

**If you are considering selling your home in today’s market, I recommend that you interview at least two to three agents** and really understand what each of them will do for you. You should choose the one who is going to put together the best strategy for you to sell your property in a reasonable amount of time for the maximum price.

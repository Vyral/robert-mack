Most sellers underestimate how long it’ll take to sell their home and how quickly they can transition into a new home.

I had a client who wanted to list their home in spring in order to move into a new home that’ll be completed in the middle of the year. As these things take time to happen, I suggested we get together now to reverse engineer the process and figure out what needs to be done. In our meeting, we talked about home preparation, pre-marketing and marketing, the negotiation period, closing, and the transition into their new home.

**One thing we took into consideration is that there are several wildcards**—the days in escrow can vary greatly, and price range and market conditions can also make a huge difference in a home sale. One homeowner could think the entire process will take 30 to 45 days, but it could actually take 75 to 100 days to finally sell. Another may think their home is ready to go, but we may take a look and decide it’s best if a designer comes to spruce things up.

Whether you’re planning on selling tomorrow or in two years, **I want to meet with you now to determine the best course of action for you to take.** By finding out your goals, we can work backward to figure out ways to accomplish them. The last thing you want to do is be rushing around to get your home listed—the process is stressful enough as it is already\! So let’s sit down and implement the strategy that works best for you.

If you’d like to set up a consultation, have any questions, or need more information, reach out to me. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

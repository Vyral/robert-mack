<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Here’s why you’re getting so many phone calls from agents.</em></p>

My team and I have been selling homes in the Orange County area for 15 years, and a big portion of our business comes from helping homeowners who tried selling in the past but were unsuccessful. We call these ‘canceled’ or ‘expired’ listings (and, sometimes, ‘withdrawn’). There are rules we have to follow when handling these types of listings.&nbsp;

So if you've failed to sell your home in the past and are now receiving a ton of calls from different agents, you may be wondering: "Where the heck were these people when my home was for sale?"

{% include pullquote.html %}

When a home doesn’t sell and comes off the market, it becomes public record. In my experience, I know that homes come off the market for a variety of reasons. The problem could've been the agent, the home itself, personal issues with the seller, etc. You name it, I’ve heard it. I also know that 35% of all homes that come off the market are relisted within 60 days. Basically, **you’re getting all these phone calls because agents are looking for more business.&nbsp;**

I’ll go out on a limb here and say that roughly nine out of every 10 agents don’t have the experience to help you rebrand and reposition your property so that it sells at a record price. My team and I absolutely understand why homes don’t sell, and we call canceled listings daily. We know that there are would-be sellers out there who are confused and frustrated because they have all these agents calling them, sending them things in the mail, and knocking on their door. It can all be quite overwhelming—especially during the first week.&nbsp;

The best advice I can give you to deal with this situation is to **listen to what these agents have to say.** If you still need to sell, make a list of the agents you feel have the necessary experience to get the job done. I recommend interviewing anywhere from three to five agents to find the best one. Remember, not all agents are the same. We all have different experience levels, marketing strategies, team structures, networks, and processes we follow.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of putting your home back on the market or need to sell but don’t know where to start, give me a call. My team and I would love to be a resource for you and apply for the job of being your real estate agent. Until then, happy selling\!&nbsp;

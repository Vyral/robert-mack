In all the years I’ve been making videos, I think this is the first time I’m talking about the topic of getting real estate advice from friends and family. Look, I’m not saying that you should brush off the people you love and trust the most when it comes to buying or selling a home. However,I’ve seen many more friends and family members derail my clients’ dreams and goals compared to those that helped. **Everyone thinks they’re an expert—that’s the big problem.&nbsp;**

Many times, I’ll talk to a buyer or seller, give them my advice as a full-time real estate professional, then they’ll go against it based on the expert “advice” of a parent, co-worker, or friend who has a license. I always follow up with, “How many homes has this person sold?” Nine times out of 10, the person isn’t even in the industry. It blows my mind that someone would take advice from someone who isn’t an expert.&nbsp;

If you don’t have experience in an industry, your advice means nothing. **My team has the experience.** We have one of the best reputations in the country.

Just last week, a buyer called me reluctantly. They proceeded to tell me that they wished they would have bought the year before when I advised them to. Their dad told them not to buy, but that decision ended up pricing them out of the market. If they would have taken my advice, they would be riding this wave of appreciation right now.

We told another client that they could bump up their sale price significantly with a little staging. **We sold it for $30,000 less than we could have because they didn’t want to stage based on advice from a friend** who wasn’t even in the industry. I’m not saying you shouldn’t listen to your friends and family or only listen to me, but keep an open mind. Trust the numbers, trust an expert, and let’s talk through your situation.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

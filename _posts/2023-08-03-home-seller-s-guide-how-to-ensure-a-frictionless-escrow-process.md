As a home seller, few things are as important as keeping your escrow process silky smooth. That will help you close on time and with as little friction as possible. Nothing hinders a sale like being forced to deal with issues and repairs during escrow. Fortunately, there are two great ways you can avoid this. Set yourself up to win by following these two steps:&nbsp;

**1\. Have backup offers.** If you have a list of offers that are close to the one currently in escrow, you have the negotiating power to walk away from costly and time-consuming repairs. This keeps buyers accountable because, in most circumstances, they would rather buy the home as-is than risk losing it.&nbsp;

**2\. Do a pre-listing inspection.** Buyers will often count on the inspection to reveal reasons why they should get credits or repairs. By doing a pre-listing inspection, you can prepare for and avoid those kinds of offers before they get off the ground.

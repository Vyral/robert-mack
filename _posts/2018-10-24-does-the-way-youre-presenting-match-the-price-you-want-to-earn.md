Every single seller I know wants to earn top dollar, but very few sellers are willing to do what it takes to put out a product that’s worthy of that goal.

This disconnect is one of the main reasons a property might sit on the market. To avoid this, there’s one simple rule sellers must follow: **Presentation is everything.**

Your property shouldn’t look “lived in” when a buyer comes by for a showing. Instead, it should look like a model home. Anything less will make it very hard for you to generate the kinds of offers you want or any offers at all.

**Every single room should be neat, well staged, and have a clear purpose.** If you have a four-bedroom home you’re looking to sell, then you need to present it as just that: a four-bedroom home. That means if one of these bedrooms is currently acting as a storage closet while you’re preparing for your move, then it’s time to clear it out. Don’t show your home at anything less than its full potential.

I recently toured a property that had an amazing loft. It would’ve been a perfect space for a living room or game room, but instead of utilizing it in an appealing way, the seller had filled it with boxes. **This is a perfect example how the quality of a listing can be dragged down by a lack of presentation.**

It doesn’t matter how much (or how little) you’re selling your listing for; you need to showcase your home in its best light. A low price doesn’t mean you can get away with offering low quality. The person buying your home is likely scraping together everything they’ve got. Therefore, you’ve got to do your part to make the experience worth their time—and their money.

**To earn top dollar for your home, whatever that may be, you and your agent will need to develop a “vision” for your property.**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

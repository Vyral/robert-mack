Nobody has a crystal ball that can predict the future of the real estate market, but do you ever wish you could? Depending on what resources you have been looking at, you may have recently found some conflicting information about the state of the housing market. My personal opinion is that this isn’t a market we can look too far into the future with; it's changing too rapidly. That is why I want to share what the market is like right now so you can make smart decisions about whether or not to buy or sell.&nbsp;

**You can learn all about this by watching the video above, or you can use these timestamps to direct you to specific parts of the video:**

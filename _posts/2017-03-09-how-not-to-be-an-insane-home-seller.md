When it comes to selling your home, are you insane?

Albert Einstein once said, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.”

If you’ve tried to sell your home in the past and were unsuccessful, today’s message is for you. As I reach out to other homeowners who’ve tried to sell their homes in the past and failed, a lot of them tell me they’re going to give their current agent another shot at it. I always ask the same follow-up question: “What is your current agent going to do differently this time around to get the job done?”

In most cases, these homeowners didn’t know what their agent was going to do in the first place, let alone what they’ll do differently the second time around. If you’re one of these people, that’s the definition of insanity.&nbsp;

**If you want to make sure your home sale succeeds the second time around, you have two options.** You can either talk to your agent about how they’ll change their marketing strategy or interview two or three new agents to learn what they can do for you to sell your home for the most money in the shortest amount of time.

If you have any questions about this topic or any other topics in the world of real estate, please don’t hesitate to reach out to me. As always, if you have any video ideas you’d like me to cover in the future, let me know. Until then, happy selling\!&nbsp;

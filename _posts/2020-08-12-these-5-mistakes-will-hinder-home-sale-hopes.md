Ours is a strong seller’s market, but sometimes people get overeager and make more mistakes when the cards are stacked in their favor. Many sellers don’t realize that it can take two to three months to get their home ready to sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;

Even though we’re super low on inventory, about 30% to 35% of that supply is what’s considered ‘stale’ because some sellers think this market gives them the privilege to price their homes ridiculously. Yes, the market is on fire, but buyers aren’t stupid. Today I’m sharing the five big mistakes sellers need to avoid for their home sale to go off without a hitch.

Sellers: Never forget your main motivation for selling. For example, let’s say you get an offer that’s $10,000 below what you want. If you know you can get more than that, go for it, but if there’s room for doubt, consider accepting that offer; doing so means you’ll be one step closer to selling the home, and therefore one step closer to your big picture goal.&nbsp;

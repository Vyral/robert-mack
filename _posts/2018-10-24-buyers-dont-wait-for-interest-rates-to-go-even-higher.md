You’ve probably heard by now that interest rates are at a seven-year high, but what does this actually mean for your real estate goals?

**Interest rates have been held artificially low to stimulate the housing market for some time now, but this is no longer the case.** Buyers have been complaining for six years now about how difficult it is to find a house. What they might not realize is that this lack of supply has largely been a result of the interest rates we were seeing during that time.

Now that rates have begun to steadily creep up, though, it’s no longer a matter of buyers being unable to find a home—instead, buyers are simply choosing not to look. Despite the fact that inventory has risen and overall conditions have leveled out, many buyers are letting a fear of the unknown prevent them from taking advantage of these favorable conditions.&nbsp;

Instead of focusing on list price alone, buyers must start considering where affordability is headed. **Interest rates are still historically low, so locking in a rate today is a far better choice than waiting things out and hoping for the best in the future.**

The last thing my team and I want is for a buyer to miss the opportunity to secure a home at a rate that works for their budget. If you wait too long to buy, you may have a much harder time affording a home at all.

We recently worked with a client who told our team that if they had put off their move any longer, they would’ve been unable to make it happen at all. These buyers went under contract a month ago, and **if they would’ve waited until today to do so, their payment would’ve been an extra $181 per month.**

So if you’re on the fence about purchasing a property, yourself, now is the time to get in touch with a lender and become educated on your options.

And, as always, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

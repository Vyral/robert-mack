I recently spoke to a homeowner who was unsuccessful at selling their home in the past. When we started talking about the type of preparation his previous agent had him do before his home went on the market, **I found out his previous agent didn’t really do anything to prepare it.** He got his listing contract signed, put a sign in the front of the house, took some photos, and started showing it three days after he met the seller.

The “4-1 rule” is something that we utilize on most of our listings, especially those that were unsuccessful at selling in the past. It boils down to spending four weeks preparing the home to sell so that it can sell within one week of being listed on the MLS. Nine out of 10 sellers who follow this rule end up winning.

Why do we need four whole weeks to get your home ready? Well, every situation is different, but there are always things we can do to improve a home’s appearance. A typical home needs some minor repairs and a deep cleaning at the very least. We also take photos, shoot video, create flyers, pre-market the home online, and stage it. The list goes on and on.&nbsp;

**To truly prepare a home to sell for top dollar, you’ve got to take a few weeks to prepare.** Once it hits the market, you have a top-quality product.

If you have any questions for me or want to know how our team can prepare and market your home differently than your previous agent did, give us a call or send us an email today. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

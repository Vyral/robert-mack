We should always be grateful for everything that we have, but in November especially, people tend to lean on the concept of gratitude in honor of Thanksgiving. One thing that I’ve learned in my life and career is that the more things we are grateful for, the more things we’ll have *to be* grateful for.

By that, **I mean if you choose to focus on the things that aren’t going well in your life, you’ll continue to find things that aren’t good in your life.** Likewise, if you choose to focus on the things you’re grateful for, the more opportunities there will be in your life to show gratitude. In short, good things happen to happy people.

Of course, I’m grateful for my team and all the clients we serve. I’m also grateful for the housing market and everything we’ve been able to achieve in it over the last 16 years. With that, today I want to talk about gratitude as it relates to the consumer. Whether you’re thinking about buying or selling, gratitude can really make a difference in your life.

We work with a good number of referral clients—people who know, like, and trust us. However, we also meet a lot of people through social media who treat us with skepticism. They don’t know us and might have their own prejudices about real estate agents besides. In my experience, I’ve noticed that the buyers and sellers who expect this process to be time-consuming, expect not to form a trusting relationship with their agents, or who believe their agent doesn’t have their best interests in mind usually get exactly what they expect in the end.

On the other hand, the clients who come in after being referred to us by a friend or family member or reading an online review and are ready to accept our expert advice on how to prepare for a home sale are generally the clients who come away satisfied. They understand that we’re the pros who know what we’re doing and that we know what it takes for them to win.

All in all, the buyers and sellers who are grateful for the expert help they receive when they work with a fantastic, trustworthy agent tend to have a better all-around experience.

If you have any questions about buying or selling property, don’t hesitate to reach out to me via phone or email, and be sure to follow us on social media. Until next time, Happy Thanksgiving\!

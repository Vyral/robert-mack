It isn’t always easy to let go of the past.

We’ve been experiencing a strong seller’s market for almost seven years now. As a facet of this, home prices have been aggressively appreciating all the while.&nbsp;

However, **our market is shifting gears.** Homes are taking longer to sell and appreciation has slowed down. And, beyond that, inventory and rates are both on the rise.

The best advice I can give anyone who is thinking of buying or selling is to let go of the past. It’s important to base your goals and expectations on what’s happening right now, instead of what was going on a month ago.

**Buyers and sellers who don’t move with the market are setting themselves up for failure.** Sellers, in particular, should remember that less is more. Pricing your property slightly below where you may have in the recent past could help you sell sooner and for more money than you would earn by overpricing.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

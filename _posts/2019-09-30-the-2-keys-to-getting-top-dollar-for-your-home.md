<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Your home’s list price and how it shows are the two keys to focus on if you want to sell it for top dollar.</em></p>

There’s a lot that goes into selling a home for top dollar. First of all, you have to work with the right agent and the right team to make sure they assist you in executing your plan.

If you don’t have an agent though, you should know that are two keys to getting top dollar for your home: **its list price and how it shows.&nbsp;**

About 92% of all buyers will see your home online before they visit it, and if it doesn’t look great online, they might not want to see it in person. More importantly, buyers are very picky when it comes to what they’re willing to spend money on these days, and buyer demand has dropped since it peaked earlier in the year. This is why **you must price your home strategically.**

Oftentimes, the list price my team and I set for our clients isn’t necessarily the price we want to sell the home for—it’s the bait. What can we do knowing that every buyer wants a good deal? How can we price a home so that it gives buyers the impression that it’s a great deal? Also, how can we maximize its exposure? We know that if more buyers see your home, you have a better chance of attracting multiple offers. If your home’s price is aggressive and attractive, they’ll want to see it.&nbsp;

That’s just step one, though, because if they walk in your door and don’t see something they love, that will lead to a huge disconnect. That’s why the next step is to **make your home look like a model home**. It should look so nice that buyers fall in love with it instantaneously and feel compelled to make an offer. If you can make more than one buyer feel that way, you have a multiple-offer situation on your hand. All that’s left is to see who’s willing to pay the most for your home.&nbsp;

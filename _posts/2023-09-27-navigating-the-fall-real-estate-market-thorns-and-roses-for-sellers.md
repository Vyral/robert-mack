Are you thinking about selling this fall? Today I’m sharing two thorns and two roses that you need to consider for a successful sale.

Here are the two thorns you need to know about:

**1\. The lack of a replacement property.** While not every seller needs a new home, those who do may face difficulties due to the limited options available.

**2\. High interest rates.** Although you, as a seller, may not be directly impacted by interest rates, the buyers of your property might be. High interest rates can affect their ability to secure a loan and may impact the price they can offer for your home.

Here are the roses:

**1\. Minimal competition in the current market.** Not everyone is listing their properties, leading to low inventory levels. This means that motivated sellers like you are in high demand.

**2\. Homes priced accurately and in good condition are still selling.** Despite affordability challenges, well-presented homes that are priced appropriately are still selling for record prices. If you want to maximize the equity from your sale, now could be an excellent time to do so.

If you need more information about the market, or have any real estate questions, call or email me. I’m always happy to help.

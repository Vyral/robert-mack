There was a lot of speculation in late 2018 as to where interest rates would end up in 2019. Many thought that rates were incredibly volatile and that we’d see them hit 6% this year.

Well, I don’t believe that’s going to happen. **In fact, the highest we’re likely to see is around 5.5%.** While buyers are waiting for home prices to flatten out or drop, they fail to realize that the savings they find will be at the cost of higher interest rates. **By waiting, they could end up paying more money for less home.**

But yes, buyers—rates are volatile. Though they shouldn’t surpass 5.5%, you should still speak with a lender to see what you should do. Sellers, interest rate fluctuations affect you too. **Who will buy your property if buyers can’t qualify for loans because rates are too high?**

The best time to buy or sell may soon be ending, so I suggest you reach out to me to be put in contact with a lender, get any questions you have answered, and learn more information about your specific situation. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

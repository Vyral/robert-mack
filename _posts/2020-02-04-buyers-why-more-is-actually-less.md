We’ve all heard the expression, “Less is more,” but what do I mean when I say the reverse?&nbsp;

If you’re a buyer out there, there are a few things you’ll want to know about our current market. Inventory is about 40% lower than it was at this time last year. Interest rates are almost a full percentage point lower than this time last year. So there’s a massive amount of demand but simply not enough homes out there to satisfy.&nbsp;

When a great home does hit the market at a fair price, multiple offers usually drive its price up.&nbsp;**The home buying process is all about removing the emotion and creating as much certainty as possible**. For example, speaking with a lender and knowing what your monthly payment will be creates certainty and gives you more confidence as a buyer.&nbsp;

To illustrate my point, here’s an example: There was a property in Irvine and my clients absolutely loved it. It was one of the only 4-bedroom properties in the entire city, and, since my clients needed four bedrooms, the demand in this equation was very, very high.&nbsp;

This property was listed for $750,000. After we looked at what other similar homes in the area sold for and did the math, we felt as though $770,000—maybe $775,000—would work. Ultimately, we came in super strong and got the offer accepted at $780,000.&nbsp;

My clients admitted to feeling as though they paid too much for the home—a sentiment I do understand. However, a couple of weeks later, the exact same home model came onto the MLS at $790,000 and, after receiving tons of offers, went under contract just shy of $800,000.&nbsp;

This is where the ‘more is less’ mantra comes into play: My clients were comfortable paying a little more to secure a highly sought-after home now, knowing that it would go for money the next time it’s sold on the market.&nbsp;

**Though they offered more, they’re still paying a lot less than the next person in line who tried to get the same type of home.** Alas, more is less\!&nbsp;

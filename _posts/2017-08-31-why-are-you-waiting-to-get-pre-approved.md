Over the course of my career, I’ve met a lot of buyers who’ve wanted to wait before getting pre-approved.

**Some people want to wait because they are afraid to commit to a Realtor or lender, while others hesitate because they’re nervous about having their credit pulled.** There are also those who simply feel intimidated by the fact that a pre-approval makes the prospect of a transaction seem a little more “real.”&nbsp;

Having nerves before purchasing a home is common and absolutely normal. I, myself, have become desensitized to the process through years of experience. I’ve helped so many people buy homes that my perspective on the ordeal is a lot different from that of a buyer.&nbsp;

However, that’s exactly the benefit of working with a professional. **Professional agents have the knowledge and experience to navigate a transaction based on what will get results.** Getting pre-approved can give buyers a lot of peace of mind.

Knowing what loan you’ll be using, how much you can afford, and what your monthly payments will be like is all very valuable information—all of which you will learn through getting pre-approved.

So, why are you waiting? **Knowing why you don’t feel ready to get pre-approved would help me to better understand and service buyers just like you.** The market right now is very competitive. No seller is going to consider a buyer who lacks a pre-approval letter.&nbsp;

Most listing agents will also contact the lender even after receiving a pre-approval letter to confirm that they are qualified to purchase a home.&nbsp;

So, if you aren’t pre-approved yet and are nervous about the process, I want to hear from you. I would love for you to contact me with your thoughts.

Also, if you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

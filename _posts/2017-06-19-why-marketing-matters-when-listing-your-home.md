If you’ve tried to sell your home in the past but were unsuccessful, today’s message is for you. **How you market your home matters when you list it for sale.** Let me share a quick story to show you what I mean.&nbsp;

In late 2016, I spoke with a homeowner who had listed his home on the market for four months at a price of $485,000. After his listing expired, I introduced myself, told him I’d done my research on his home, and said I thought $485,000 was a very fair price for the property. I offered to meet with him and strategize how we could still sell his home for a great price, but we went back and forth for about three or four months because he wasn’t quite ready to put his home back on the market.&nbsp;

Finally, in the beginning of 2017, we listed his home for the same exact price as it had been listed before. The only difference was that we actually put forth the time and effort into getting it ready for the market. We had it professionally cleaned, we enlisted a handyman to make some minor repairs to it, and had an interior designer stage it to give buyers that emotional connection they crave when they walk into a property. We also had professional photos taken and used heavy online and offline marketing.&nbsp;

After receiving multiple offers, we sold the property in two days for $498,000, which was $13,000 more than what he listed it at the first time with his first agent.&nbsp;

If you’ve tried to sell your property in the past and failed, it’s not necessarily the price you were trying to achieve that prevented your home from getting sold. **Many times, it’s the marketing and the exposure that your home didn’t get that caused it to become an expired listing.**&nbsp;

If you experienced an expired listing before and are thinking you might want to give selling your home another shot, I’d love to sit down with you and put together a strategy to help you sell your property for a great price.&nbsp;

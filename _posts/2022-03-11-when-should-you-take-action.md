Is it time to take action? If you’re asking that question, it might be. Here’s what I mean.

I’ve been getting personal real estate coaching for over 10 years from a company called the Tom Ferry organization. I wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the guidance that Tom Ferry and his team provided me.

About seven years ago, Tom and I were having lunch, and I asked him, “When can I tell it’s time to change coaches?” He said if I was asking that question, it was already time.

I work with dozens of buyers and sellers who ask these sorts of hypothetical questions. Should I sell, or is it a good time to buy? **If you’re asking these kinds of questions, it’s time to explore your options.** Why don’t you find out?

A lot of people are afraid of reaching out to an agent because they think they’ll be pressured to make a decision they aren’t ready for. In reality, my team and I can do so much for our clients beyond buying and selling. We have dozens of services that can help you make some of the hardest decisions in your life.

If you’re a buyer or seller, let’s explore your options. There’s never any cost, commitment, or obligation. Our goal is to enable you to make the best decisions you can.

Even if you just want someone to bounce ideas off of, call or email us.&nbsp; If you think someone else could find value in this video, please send it to them. Also, if you have any ideas for future videos, send those my way as well. We would be happy to help.

Homes exit the market all the time for various reasons—the sellers might have been unmotivated, or they might have partnered with inept agents. Statistics show that homeowners often hire the first agent they talk to, but that person may not always be the best for the job. **There are over 20,000 agents in Orange County, and last year, only 400 of those agents sold 10 homes or more.** Not everybody has the experience that a seller needs to get the best price, and some sellers are finding that out the hard way.

Once your home falls off the market, you may find that you’re being contacted by many agents who are looking for ways to generate new business. Expired listings are an easy way to have a conversation with a motivated seller that may lead to a potential listing.

So, once your home fails to sell, what’s the next step? Here are three things you can do to set yourself up for success as you field all those incoming calls from agents:

**1\. Focus on the agents who make an impression.** Around 90% of the agents who call you on day one will never call you again. So if you don’t want to sell, don’t worry; the calls will stop. But if you are committed to selling, think about which agents are leaving an impression on you and ask them questions to ensure they know what they’re talking about.

**2\. Ask the agent how many houses they sold in the last 12 months.** That will help you determine if the agent you’re speaking to has the experience necessary to sell your home.

**3\. Ask the agent what separates them from the others who are calling you.** Most great agents will immediately be able to list two or three things that separate them from their competition.&nbsp;

If you’ve found yourself in the situation where you tried to sell your home and still need to, reach out to me and my team. I’d love the opportunity to talk with you about how we can help.

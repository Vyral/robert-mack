Are you going to wait until the springtime to list your home?

If you’ve been following my video blog, you’ve seen all my latest market updates. I’ve talked about both selling during the holidays and selling during the springtime.&nbsp;

Spring is a very active time to sell. From now until then, home prices will probably rise a little bit, so you’ve got that on your side. One thing a lot of people don’t consider, though, is that listing inventory will dramatically rise in February and March. There are a few reasons why. One of which is a lot of people are convinced that springtime is the absolute best time to sell. No matter what anybody tells them, they’ll put their home on the market in February, March, or April.&nbsp;

Many sellers—contrary to my belief—think it’s a bad time to list their home because nobody is really looking for homes. In reality, **a lot of homes sell during this time for amazing prices.** When the new year comes, we see a huge influx of homes pop up on the market. If there’s a significant rise in inventory, the demand for your specific home will be lower. When buyers have more choices, they have more leverage.&nbsp;

So, while springtime is a very active time to sell a home, you’ll have a lot more competition and your home may be overshadowed by all the other homes on the market in your area. The reason I bring this up is because you’re either considering selling your home or you’ve tried to sell in the past and were unsuccessful.&nbsp;

If you know me, you know that I call a lot of homeowners who were unsuccessful selling their home in the past. Many of them say they’re not interested in selling their home until February, March, or April because they’ve heard that’s the best time to list.&nbsp;

I tell them the same thing I’m telling you today—**if you’re looking to sell your home for top dollar, it’s usually best to sell when inventory is low and demand is high.**&nbsp;

Keep in mind, though, everyone’s situation is unique, and it’s impossible to time the market perfectly. That’s why you want to focus on what your needs are first. If you can’t sell until March or April, then you can’t sell until March or April. If you have some flexibility, though, you might want to consider my advice. It could help you come away with an extra $10,000, $15,000, or even $50,000.&nbsp;

If you have any questions or you’re considering putting your home back on the market in the very near future or next spring and you’re wondering what it’s worth, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. Until then, happy selling\!

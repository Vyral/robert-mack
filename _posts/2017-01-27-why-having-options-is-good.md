If you’re reading this, it’s very likely you have tried to sell your home in the past and were unsuccessful. When this happens, you are either going to give up, relist your property with the same agent who was unable to get the job done the first time, or relist your property sometime in the near future. I’m writing this for the last group—**those of you looking to hire a new agent to sell your home.**

My recommended strategy has always been to interview three or four new agents for the job of selling your home. Every agent has a different personality, strategy, network of service providers, marketing plan, etc. If you’ve seen my articles in the past, you know that not all agents are created equally. **As you’re interviewing them, keep these things in mind:**

**1\. The connection.** You need to make sure you have a good connection with the Realtor you’re considering hiring. You want to have a good rapport and open lines of communication. Selling a home can be overwhelming and if you don’t have a great relationship with your Realtor, the expected outcome can not be good.

**2\. Understand what the Realtor’s marketing plan is.** How will they get the word out and maximize the exposure of your property? How are the buyers out there going to know your home is for sale? A good marketing strategy is so important.

**3\. Social proof.** Ask the agent you’re considering what their track record is and what they can do for you that will inspire you to hire them. You have to ask these questions before you sign that paperwork because you don’t want the same thing to happen to you again.

If you have any questions for us or know anyone who has been unsuccessful in buying or selling a home, give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.

What are you willing to sacrifice in order to buy a new home?

As our market tightens and shifts, buyers and sellers tend to get pickier. In the last few months, we’ve seen transactions where both parties came to a standstill during negotiations when they were just a few thousand dollars apart. I always tell my clients that if they’re spending upwards of $750,000 or $1 million on a property, a few thousand dollars shouldn’t stand in the way of them getting what they want.&nbsp;

**A lot of us, though—myself included—spend money on things that don’t help our bottom line.** For example, let’s say you buy a $5 Starbucks coffee for 15 days out of every month. That equates to $75 you’re spending each month on Starbucks coffee when you could be saving close to that amount by just making coffee at home.&nbsp;

If you were to spend an extra $10,000 on the home you want, your monthly mortgage payment would increase between $60 and $75 anyway, so **think about what you’re spending money on that you could potentially eliminate** so that you can give yourself a better chance at affording that home.&nbsp;

In other words, think about what you’re willing to sacrifice for the greater good.&nbsp;

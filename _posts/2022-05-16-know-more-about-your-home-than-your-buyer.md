Are you looking to sell your home? If so, your buyer should never know more about your property than you. I can’t count the number of times a seller I’m working with thought their house was in perfect condition, only for the buyer to find a huge issue in the home inspection. How can you prevent this situation?&nbsp;

The only way to make sure you don’t get caught off guard by the home inspection is to have an inspection of your own. I know; it sounds a little weird. After all, why would you do the buyer’s job for them? However, there are many benefits to doing a pre-listing inspection:

**1\. It helps you understand your property.** You can decide which repairs you want to make before heading to the market.

**2\. If you don’t want to fix something, you can disclose it.** This way, your buyers know what they’re getting into upfront and don’t have an excuse to ask for concessions.&nbsp;

**3\. It gives the buyer more confidence.** Many buyers are skeptical about what you’re hiding. If you include your inspection report, buyers will be reassured that they can make a strong offer.&nbsp;

**4\. It smooths over escrow.** When buyers ask for repairs, they often try to renegotiate in escrow. This can create turbulence and even tank a sale. Without renegotiations, this process is easy.&nbsp;

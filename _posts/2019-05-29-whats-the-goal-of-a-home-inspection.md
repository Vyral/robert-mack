If you’re getting ready to buy a property, you’re probably wondering what you can do to make sure the home is as good as it seems. A home is a costly investment, so the last thing anyone wants is to spend a lot of money only to encounter some unpleasant surprises.

This is what makes home inspections so valuable. Today, I want to break the subject of home inspections down into two parts.&nbsp;

First, what kind of home inspections should you get? Usually, we recommend that our clients start with a general home inspection. We can certainly recommend a company to our clients, though some clients may already have an inspector in mind. Either way, **a general home inspection will provide a basic overview of a home’s condition.&nbsp;**

If the home inspector doesn’t find any significant issues, many people will feel comfortable proceeding without further inspections. But if the inspector does find something wrong, they may recommend that you contact a specialized professional, such as a plumber or roofer, to take a more in-depth look at the problem.&nbsp;

At that point, the next step may be to have a specialty inspection performed. But remember, each inspection you have will be an additional cost. Ideally, you should strike a balance between feeling comfortable with the home and not spending too much money on frivolous or unnecessary inspections.&nbsp;

Every situation and every home is different. Therefore, **there is no one answer as to which inspections will be necessary.&nbsp;**

The second area I’d like to focus on in regards to home inspections is what to do if you discover a problem.&nbsp;

Homes in California are sold as-is. What you see is what you get. This is why home inspections are so valuable. Something we want to help our clients understand, though, is that older homes won’t come in perfect condition. We aren’t going to ask the seller to clean the carpets, repaint, or change out a mirror that’s losing silvering.&nbsp;

When a home inspection is performed, cosmetic issues and upgrades aren’t the focus. If a home was up to code at the time it was built, the seller doesn’t need to make updates that would make it current. **If you buy an older home, you should expect to pay some of your own money making these upgrades.&nbsp;**

Home inspections are meant to detect issues that are more serious, such as those that cause safety concerns. If you work with our team, we can help you review the inspection. We’ll then negotiate on your behalf to try to see what we can get the seller to fix or give you a credit for. However, the seller can say no to any request, even those that are safety issues.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

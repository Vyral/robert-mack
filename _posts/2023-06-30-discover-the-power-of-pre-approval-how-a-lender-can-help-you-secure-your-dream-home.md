Today, I'm talking to all the buyers out there who are interested in purchasing a home and emphasizing the importance of talking to a lender. Here are three reasons why:

**1\. Free advice.** If you're truly motivated to buy a home, it's crucial to become familiar with the numbers. While it may seem like a hassle to go through the process with a lender, it's necessary if you want to make informed decisions.

**2\. Discover loan options.** Online tools can provide basic loan calculations, but there are numerous programs available that you may not be aware of. New programs are constantly emerging, and some can help you qualify for a higher purchase price while keeping your monthly payments low. Examples include investor loans, two-one buy-downs, and bank statement loans.

**3\. Position yourself to win.** With low inventory and high demand, the best homes are being snatched up by prepared and qualified buyers. Being proactive and prepared gives you an advantage in this competitive market. Even if you're not ready to buy immediately, talking to a lender and understanding your options puts you in a favorable position when the time is right.

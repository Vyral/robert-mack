If you’re thinking of selling your home, your home is already on the market but hasn’t sold, or you tried to sell it once and failed, there’s one question you need to ask yourself: **Is it time to get realistic?**

If you have a great agent with a great marketing plan, your home shows well, and you’ve priced it appropriately, this question doesn’t apply to you. However, 35% of all home sellers out there have homes that comprise what we call “stale inventory,” meaning they’ve sat on the market for anywhere from 40 to 60 days and they’re still not selling.&nbsp;

As we know, there are three keys to selling a home for record price:&nbsp;

1\. You must hire the right agent<br>2\. Your home must look like a model home<br>3\. You must price it to sell

Yes, interest rates are below 4%, inventory for great homes is still low, and it’s still a seller’s market. But that doesn’t mean buyers will overpay just to lock in that 3.75% rate. You still need to set the right price. The simple fact that most sellers are struggling with right now is that real estate is cyclical and prices are always changing. Over time the market is always going up, but in between, it goes through ups and downs.&nbsp;

Our current market, which is going through the initial stages of a shift, is not the ideal place to see if you can get lucky. You need to follow the three keys above if you want to sell for top dollar. **Stop worrying about the past and what your neighbors’ homes sold for and start focusing on why your home is on the market and what you have to do to get it sold.** That’s all that matters.&nbsp;

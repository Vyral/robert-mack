You’ve probably heard the phrase “You get what you pay for” many, many times. Generally, this is true. People will pay more for a higher quality of service. However, many companies out there today are disrupting the real estate market.

The real estate industry has operated in the same way for a long time. But, now, things are changing. That said, it isn’t surprising that companies like Redfin or Purplebricks are offering discounted service.

I can’t say that I have first-hand experience with doing real estate through these sites, but I can say that people who pay less for a service generally will receive less in return.&nbsp;

When you’re working on buying or selling a home, I would advise you to interview a few traditional Realtors. I’ve heard horror stories about websites like Redfin and Purplebricks, but it’s only fair to mention that I’ve also heard horror stories from **people who have worked with inexperienced Realtors.&nbsp;**

There are a lot of Realtors out there. A large number of them are probably just winging it, so **I highly recommend seeking out professionals that make up the top 10% or 15% of the industry.**

My best advice is to do your research before making a decision on how to move forward with your real estate goals. Instead of focusing on how much you’re going to pay someone to help you sell your home, focus on what you’ll earn once the transaction is complete.

Real estate is a big industry, but a small community. Realtors in any given area will know one another, so **it’s important to work with someone who has a good reputation.** Sometimes you have to spend more to earn more. So, focus on the big picture.

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

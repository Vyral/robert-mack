In the current real estate market, buyers are facing the challenge of higher interest rates, with figures around 7% being daunting for many. It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when considering the impact of these rates on monthly payments. However, despite these conditions, buyers are still actively purchasing homes. Let’s explore three effective strategies our buyers are using to create affordability in this challenging market.

**1\. Lender paid point buydown.** Some lenders are offering promotional 12-month, one-point rate buydowns. This strategy is designed to make the initial year more affordable, with the hope that buyers can refinance if rates drop within that period. It’s important to remember, however, that there's no guarantee rates will fall, so ensure you can afford the monthly payments even if refinancing isn’t an option.

**2\. Buyer or seller paid 2-1 buydown.** This approach involves reducing the interest rate for the initial years of the mortgage. For instance, if the current rate is 7%, a 2-1 buydown would mean the rate is 5% for the first year, 6% for the second, and then reverts to 7% from the third year onwards. Like the first strategy, this helps lower the initial monthly payments, giving buyers some breathing room and the possibility of refinancing in the future.

**3\. Increasing the down payment.** Another method buyers are adopting is putting more money down upfront. This can be achieved by liquidating investments, tapping into retirement accounts, or borrowing from family. A larger down payment reduces the loan balance, thereby lessening the impact of higher interest rates on the overall payment.

Navigating the real estate market with high interest rates can be challenging, but these strategies offer viable solutions to manage affordability. The key step is to consult with a lender to understand what you qualify for and tailor a plan that suits your financial situation. Remember, it’s crucial to fall in love with your financial plan before falling in love with a house. If you need more advice or guidance on navigating this market, don’t hesitate to call or email us.

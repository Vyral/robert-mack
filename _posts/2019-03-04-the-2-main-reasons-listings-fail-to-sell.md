Regardless of market conditions, there are always two key factors to blame when listings fail to sell.

**These factors are price and exposure.** If you tried and failed to sell in the past, it’s very likely your listing was hindered by one (or both) of these things.

That said, this doesn’t mean you did anything wrong. Often, it’s the agent who’s to blame. If an agent wasn’t able to create sufficient exposure for your home, then the fact that it failed to sell falls squarely on their shoulders—not yours.
